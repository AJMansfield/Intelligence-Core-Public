Kai Travels the Ultiverse, Question 1!

By some miraculous twist of fate, I've found myself in your world. Somewhere random, chosen by you. What do I need to do to adapt quickly, so that I can survive? I'm a young 17 year old male with a broad spectrum of basic skills, so I can adapt relatively well. Maybe I'm out in the wilderness, so describe what I need to eat and what I should avoid. Maybe, I'm in a dictatorship city in your world, so I need to law low. Perhaps, I've found myself in a laboratory and have to survive a trial of experiments. Whatever the case is, I'm looking for how I'll mainly acquire Food, Water and Shelter. Get creative!

Kai Travels the Ultiverse Question 2

Last, I found myself in your worlds, stranded, alone and looking for work to get food, water and shelter. Well, time to sort of look deeper into this! I've found myself in a settlement of yours. Perhaps its a big, massive city, maybe it's a small village that I'm hopefully welcome in. I have a job, but... what's your currency like? What can I look forward to in the economy? With the job I've landed, what luxuries could I look forward to?

Tell me; what is your economy like?

Kai Travels the Ultiverse Question 3!

So, I've survived your world from being dropped in at the age of 17, I've found food, water and shelter. I have a job in a nice town, I'm making enough to support myself. Well, I'm still young! By this point, we will say 20 years old. Well, love is in the air today!

I'm longing for love, so what are the courtship traditions in my new place of residence? What does your world think of LGBTQ? What about traditions of children? Am I expected to have a certain amount of children with my spouse (if applicable)?

Kai Travels the Ultiverse, Question 4!

Kai is now 30 years old. He's survived the wilderness, found a job and settled into a nice city or town. He's now been married to his significant other for a year, had as many children as possible in the span of 10 years and, well, life was good. But at 30, Kai lost his wife, his family and his home. The only money left to his name is his last paycheck, which he got yesterday. With everything he built up crumbling down and a bit of a mid-life crisis setting in, it's time for a change of pace.

I want to go adventuring! Where do I begin and what treasures await my eyes? What dangers come with the job? What can I dream for with my new life?
Tell me everything!

Kai Travels the Ultiverse Questions 5 + 6!

So I dropped into your world, I survived for a bit, I lived in a nice town, had a family and a number of children... then they were taken from me. I lost everything I had built up and now I've gone adventuring. I've ventured around your world for quite some time now. I started at the age of 30, I'm 40 now. What have I encountered? What did I to fear? What treasure have I found and am I rich? If I am not, what have I gained from my time adventuring? 

Question 6
I've gotten lucky during my travels and struck it rich beyond belief in your world. Where can I go to live comfortably with my riches and what can I do with them?

Kai Travels the Ultiverse Questions 7 + 8!

Well... we did it. We survived, made a living, got married and built a home. Then we lost it all, was real sad and decided to drown that out with 10 years of adventuring. I'm 42 years old, I'm rich, I found my new place of residence. Well, I'm filthy rich and I gotta use it somehow, right?

Q7: Now I'm rich, I'm living in a nice city and I've used my previous experience to marry someone and start a new family. What can I do with my life now? Am I considered an aristocrat or am I just rich? What luxuries await me?

Q8: As time passes, I begin to grow bored. I can't go adventuring again, my family needs me this time around. So, what can I do to pass the time? Money is obviously no issue, so what can I do?

Kai Travels the Ultiverse, Questions 9 + 10!

"Everybody wants a happy ending. Right? But it doesn't always roll out that way... Part of the journey is the end." -Tony Stark, Avengers: Endgame 2019

Just a cheeky reference to the movie, but it's true. This has been a wild journey and now, it's the end. Kai has been through a lot and it's sad to see it happen, but this is it. It's the end.

Question 9
I'm aging now, and the years have taken their toll on me. In my older years, I am not as spry as I once was, so can I remedy this? If not, what preparations must I take before I die?

Question 10
I've died. What preparations are made for death? My body? What happens to it? Is there an afterlife?
