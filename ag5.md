At first, Angela wasn't convinced that there was anything to worry about &mdash; she hadn't gone to any particular lengths to avoid attention since she'd arrived on Earth and she'd been fine so far.
But after hearing from them examples of others who 4chan had taken an interest in, she realized it might be prudent to try to avoid notice, at least in the short term until things died down &mdash; apparently being stalked online was _never_ a good thing, _regardless_ of one's planet of origin.

But Mike had another issue on his mind as well.
"What are we going to do in two weeks for the expo?
We _cannot_ afford to have nothing to show for or to the public we'll just be another failed 'free energy' Kickstarter.
We've already booked and paid for everything, and unless we can figure out how to make a new locator sigil that doesn't trigger an alien invasion &mdash; no offense &mdash; we _need_ to figure out something else we can show."

"None taken," Angela replied.
"I know a few basic sigils and some of the theory, but my specialty is medicine, not engineering.
Your technology is already better in nearly every way than anything I know how to make."

After some discussion the idea came up of potentially trying to reverse-engineer and replicate some of Angela's items.
While she wasn't keen on breaking something she had no replacement for, she had already replaced her high-intensity light with a human-made LED flashlight.
She had been keeping the sigil-powered one as a backup in case the LED flashlight failed, but by this point she had enough confidence in human technology to risk breaking it.

It was initially surprising to Jessica how 'industrial' feeling the device was.
She wasn't sure what she had been expecting, but given that it was "magic" powered this certainly wasn't it.
In any case though it felt very well-made, with a smooth anodized surface bearing a logo.
(According to Angela, this was the logo for "Dominion Technologies", a large multi-planet conglomerate from her birth system.)

The light measured just under five inches on a side, and mainly consisted of a large aluminum heat sink, with a metal reflector and shroud and a glass lens.
By chance, the bolts used to screw everything together were a close fit for a 5/32 inch hex key, but all of the threads were left-handed &mdash; apparently most civilizations in the wider galaxy used left-handed threads.

The red plunger on the side could be used to activate it and had a latching mechanism (like a click pen).
Apparently, it worked by moving a section of the sigil in or out of position relative to the rest.
"Apparently", because the sigil itself was covered with a thick coat of some sort of white phosphor.

This immediately presented a number of issues: not only would they have to figure out the sigil itself, but they'd probably also have to figure out how to produce more of the specific phosphor.
That was assuming they'd even be able to uncover the sigil without accidentally destroying it, and there was little chance they'd be able to get any sort of subsurface imaging done on it in time.

After putting it back together and testing the device as a whole for a few minutes, Mike picked it up to take it back to Angela.
"That's weird, it's warmer on this side of the fins than on that side.
There weren't any fans or anything though."
Mike paused for a moment, before tearing off a tiny scrap of paper from his notebook.
He carefully lifted it up and inserted it into the 'cold' side.

The scrap was instantly sucked in and ejected out the top.

Matt was busy looking at the book of tables that Angela had used the day before when drawing sigils out by hand.
The mathematical notation was unfamiliar, but with Angela's help he had been able to work out the base-twelve numeral system, and was making headway into the rest of the notation.
Although the language and symbols were unfamiliar, the underlying mathematics were all fundamentally still the same.

He had just worked out how they notated trig functions when something struck him on the back of the head.

"Hey!" 
He turned around to see it was a paper airplane, and he grabbed it as Jessica ran in.

"We've figured it out!"
Jessica tossed another paper airplane into the air and it circled around the room.

"The light?
What does that have to do with this?"
Matt indicated the crumpled plane in his hand.

"Not the light." 
Mike walked in behind her.
"There was a second sigil under the shroud that we missed the first time for blowing air over the heat sink."

Matt turned the paper plane over to see a sigil printed on the underside of each wing, as the second plane continued to circle the ceiling.
"_Oh_."

Angela examined it for a moment.
"That's a really low-power sigil too &mdash; in theory a sigil like that would last for _billions_ of operating hours at that size."

"This is just _perfect_ for the expo." ((can't quite figure out how to tag this line))

Marshall Barrera sat in an uncomfortable chair wearing an uncomfortable tie.
The twenty-some other men and women in the room waited for Vice President Cohen to take her seat, so that the meeting could begin.
Once she had, the Chief of Staff stood up, and introduced the first item of bullshit for today.

Sturgeon's law stated that 90% of everything is crap.
Marshall didn't like to be cynical, but for these meetings even Sturgeon's law was a dramatic underestimate.
Even issues of actual importance were, for the majority of those here, simply an avenue for political maneuvering and intrigue.
Still, he paid as much attention as he dared &mdash; this was his job after all; hopefully he might manage to keep them from doing anything _unusually_ stupid.

The first item ended up looping back on itself several times before the matter was tabled: by the end it had essentially devolved into  regurgitating the same buzzwords over and over again in a different order.
Something about "immigrants" and "public outreach".

The next topic fared similarily, and this process continued over and over again, until suddenly something caught in his mind.
He had mostly zoned out by this point, but this brought him back almost instantly as he mentally replayed to last few sentences to try to figure out why.

--------

Hours after the expo and into the night, Matt's phone was still exploding pretty much non-stop &mdash; demands for an explanation of how it worked, requests for interviews with the company, and even several offers to buy their company outright or invest absurd sums.

They'd ran out of printouts only a few hours into the expo and had to send Jessica to try to find a copy shop to get more.
That was about when he recieved the notification that their server at the office had crashed &mdash; someone had found a link to the PDF on their website and posted it to Reddit, and by this point it was _already_ one of the most upvoted posts of all time.

By the time Mike had finally gotten cloudflare set up on their site, a news crew had shown up and demanded interviews, and an executive from Lockheed-Martin had shown up and made an offer to outright buy the company on the spot.

Needless to say, they were all simply _exhausted_ by the time the expo finally closed.

Then, Matt recieved another notification, but this one was something new.
Someone had just published a scientific paper _about_ their discovery, "Effect of Molecular Weight on the Strength of the Boutwell Effect".

--------

"So go over it again, so we all understand."
Marshall began after a moment.
"What exactly is the problem here?"

An aide handed him an (unusually thin) stapled set of pages.
He nearly tossed it aside but something about the formatting on the cover page caught his eye and he read the title.

"Application of the Boutwell Effect to Isotope Separation" He read aloud.
This wasn't some bureaucratic brief, this was an actual scientific paper.
"Go on." He quickly skimmed the abstract before turning to the end to check its citations.

The man two seats to his left spoke up.
"We received a preprint copy of &mdash;"

"Bullshit, no lies please."

The man began again.
"We intercepted this from the pub&mdash;"

"One more time, hopefully it'll sound believable on the third try."

The man glared at him for a fraction of a second, before sighing, resigned.
"This was uploaded to arxiv.org a few days ago."

"There we go."
The URL at the bottom of the page had been a dead giveaway.
"As you were saying?"
Marshall pulled out his phone and started looking up some of the paper's citations.

"This is a national security matter!"

"Uh-huh."

"We need to deal with thi&mdash;"

"Uh-huh."
Marshall had tracked down the original Reddit post with the link to the PDF of a supposedly "self-propelled paper airplane", and sent it to the printer.
It all seemed rather too good to be true to him, but there were a lot of rather credible sources backing this up, and if all it took to prove it was a piece of paper...
"And so what you're saying is, is that you all are discussing exactly how large a slice of the budget we want to allocate to their research, if this all turns out to be legitimate."

"That's not what ..." the man fell silent under Marshall's icy stare.

"I thought so too, seemed a bit premature.
I was thinking it'd probably be more practical to offer them a partnership with a national lab or something, at least to start with."

--------

"Hey, we just crossed the one million download mark on the PDF of that paper airplane." Jess walked in.

Matt paused for a moment.
"Hey Angela, you said that sigil would be good for somewhere around a billion operating hours?"

"Yeah, I think so."

"Um, I think we're gonna need some hard numbers here, this may actually be a problem."

--------

The entire room erupted around Marshall, everyone crying out their bullshit objections.
He waited for the room to quiet.
And then he waited some more.

Finally he spoke.
"Are all of you really this $%^&ing stupid?
Point number one, by a show of hands, how many of you have _actually_ read this thing?"
He gestured at the paper in front of him.

The silence that met him told him everything he needed to know.

"Here, the _second_ sentence of the _abstract_, and I quote: 
'Although this technique may have potential if further refined, the magnitude of the change is significantly smaller than would be expected if the effect depended on mass alone, and is not practical at the present time.'

He paused again. 
"That's 'researcher' for 'we couldn't get it to work _at all_', in case you were wondering.

"Oh, someone's gonna use this to build a nuke-yoo-lar bomb. Haw haw haw.

"Get your heads out of your asses, this is the first really _new_ thing in science in like a decade and you want to shut it down?

"I'm done here, we're adjourned." Marshall stood up and walked to the door.

One of the others, a woman this time, spoke up.
"Mr. President, sir, what if they won't agree to our terms?"

Marshall sighed. He hated the title.
"I suggest you come up with better terms.

"Because if you don't, someone else will."
