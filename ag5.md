At first Angela wasn't convinced that there was anything to worry about &mdash; she hadn't gone to any particular lengths to avoid attention since she'd arrived on Earth, and so far she'd been fine.
But after hearing from them examples of others who 4chan had taken an interest in, she realized it might be prudent to try to avoid notice, at least in the short term until things died down &mdash; apparently being stalked online was _never_ a good thing, _regardless_ of one's planet of origin.

But Mike had another issue on his mind as well.
"What are we going to do in two weeks for the expo?
We _cannot_ afford to have nothing to show for or to the public we'll just be another failed 'free energy' kickstarter.
We've already booked and paid for everything, and unless we can figure out how to make a new locator sigil that doesn't trigger an alien invasion &mdash; no offence &mdash; we _need_ to figure out something else we can show."

"None taken," Angela replied.
"I know a few basic sigils and some of the theory, but my specialty is medicine, not engineering.
Your technology is already better in nearly every way than anything I know how to make."

After some discussion, the idea came up of potentially trying to reverse-engineer and replicate some of Angela's items.
While she wasn't keen on breaking something she had no replacement for, she had already replaced her high-intensity light with a human-made LED flashlight.
She had been keeping the sigil-powered one as a backup in case the LED flashlight failed, but by this point she had enough confidence in human technology to risk breaking it.

It was initially suprising to Jessica how 'industrial' feeling the device was.
She wasn't sure what she had been expecting, but given that it was "magic" powered this certainly wasn't it.
In any case though it felt very well-made, with a smooth anodized surface bearing a logo.
(According to Angela, this was the logo for "Dominion Technologies", a large multi-planet conglomerate from her birth system.)

The light measured just under five inches on a side, and mainly consisted of a large aluminum heat sink, with a metal reflector and shroud and a glass lens.
By chance, the bolts used to screw everything together were a close fit for a 5/32 inch allen key, but all of the threads were left-handed &mdash; apparently most civilizations in the wider galaxy used left-handed threads.

The red plunger on the side could be used to activate it and had a latching mechanism (like a click pen).
Apparently, it worked by moving a section of the sigil in or out of position relative to the rest.
"Apparently", because the sigil itself was covered with a thick coat of some sort of white phosphor.

This immediately presented a number of issues: not only would they have to figure out the sigil itself, but they'd probably also have to figure out how to produce more of the specific phosphor.
That was assuming they'd even be able to uncover the sigil without accidentally destroying it, and there was little chance they'd be able to get any sort of subsurface imaging done on it in time.

After putting it back together and testing the device as a whole for a few minutes, Mike picked it up to take it back to Angela.
Mike: "That's weird, it's warmer on this side of the fins than on that side."
Mike paused for a moment, before holding it out and moving a sheet of paper up to the opening on the bottom until it was touching.

When he pulled his hand away, the sheet of paper stuck.

Matt was busy looking at the book of tables that Angela had used the day before when drawing sigils out by hand.
The mathematical notation was unfamiliar, but with Angela's help he had been able to work out the base-twelve numeral system, and was making headway into the rest of the notation.
Although the language and symbols were unfamiliar, the underlying mathematics were all fundamentally still the same.

He had just worked out how they notated trig functions when a paper airplane flew in the door and hit him on the back of the head.

"Hey!" he exclaimed as Jessica ran in.

"We've figured it out!"
Jessica tossed another paper airplane into the air and it circled around the room.

"The light?
What does that have to do with this?"
Matt indicated the airplane that had hit him.

"Not the light." 
Mike walked in behind her.
"There was a second sigil under the shroud that we missed the first time for blowing air over the heat sink."

Matt turned the paper plane over to see a sigil printed on the underside of each wing, as the second plane continued to circle the ceiling.
"_Oh_."

Angela examined it for a moment.
"That's a really low-power sigil too &mdash; in theory a sigil like that would last for _billions_ of operating hours at that size."

Mike was simply beaming. "This is just _perfect_ for the expo."

Marshall Barrera sat in an uncomfortable chair wearing an uncomfortable tie, and waited alongside the other twenty-some other men and women for Vice President Cohen and a few other cabinet members to arrive.
Once they had, the meeting finally started anf the Cheif of Staff introduced the first item of bullshit.
Marshall had long seen Sturgeon's Law in effect throught his life, but there was nowhere it applied more strongly than right here.
The matter under discussion itself was irrelevant &mdash; to the people in this room, this was purely a chance for political maneuvering and intrigue.
Still, he paid as much attention as he dared &mdash; this was his job after all; hopefully he might manage to keep them from making any _unusually_ stupid decisions.

The first item ended up looping back on itself several times before the matter was tabled, with different people essentially regurgitating the same buzzwords in a different order, this time something about "immigration" and "national security".

This same process continued on with other topics for several more items.
He had mostly zoned out by this point, when something caught in his mind, bringing him back almost instantly as he mentally replayed to last few sentences to try to find out why.

--------

Even a week after the expo, Matt's phone was still exploding pretty much non-stop &mdash; demands for an explanation of how it worked, requests for interviews with the company, and even several offers to buy their company outright or invest absurd sums.

But more importantly, the scientific community was going completely off the walls right now &mdash; nearly everyone had been skeptical, but the fact it was so easy to demonstrate the discovery meant that everyone who could was already racing to figure out new things about it first, and yesterday someone had published a paper on it about something he hadn't even considered, titled "Effect of Molecular Weight on the Strength of the Boutwell Effect".

--------

"So go over again, so we all understand."
Marshall began after a moment.
"What exactly is the problem here?"

An aide handed him an (unusually thin) stapled set of pages.
He nearly tossed it aside but something about the formatting on the cover page caught his eye and he read the title.

"Application of the Boutwell Effect to Isotope Separation" He read aloud.
This wasn't some burocratic brief, this was an actual scientific paper.
"Go on." He quickly skimmed the abstract before turning to the end to check its citations.

The man two seats to his left spoke up.
"We recieved a preprint copy of &mdash;"

"Bullshit, no lies please."

The man began again.
"We intercepted this from the pub&mdash;"

"One more time, hopefully it'll sound believable on the third try."

The man glared at him for a fraction of a second, before sighing, resigned.
"This was uploaded to arxiv.org a few hours ago."

"There we go."
The URL at the bottom of the page had been a dead giveaway.
"As you were saying?"
Marshall pulled out his phone and looked up one of the papers it cited, "Effect of Varying Molecular Weight on Acceleration from the Boutwell Effect".

"This is a national security matter!"

"Uh-huh."

"We need to deal with the people who came up with this &mdash"

"Uh-huh."
Marshall had tracked down the original reddit post with a link to the PDF of a supposedly "self-propelled paper airplane", and sent it to the printer.
It all seemed rather too good to be true to him, but there were a lot of rather credible sources backing this up, and if all it took to prove it was a piece of paper...
"And so what you're saying is, is that you all are discussing exactly how large a slice of the budget we want to allocate to their research, if this all turns out to be legitimate."

"That's not what ..." the man fell silent under Marshall's icy stare.

"I thought so too, seemed a bit premature.
I was thinking it'd probably be more practical to offer them a partnership with a national lab or something, at least to start with."

--------

"Hey, we just crossed the one million download mark on the PDF of that paper airplane." Jess walked in.

Matt paused for a moment.
"Hey Angela, you said that sigil would be good for somewhere around a billion operating hours?"

"Yeah, I think so."

"Um, I think we're gonna need some hard numbers here, this may actually be a problem."

--------

The entire room erupted around Marshall, everyone crying out their bullshit objections.
He waited for the room to quiet.
And then he waited some more.

Finally he spoke.
"Are all of you really this $%^&ing stupid?
Point number one, by a show of hands, how many of you have _actally_ read this thing?"
He gestured at the paper in front of him.

The silence that met him told him everything he needed to know.

"Here, the _second_ sentence of the _abstract_, and I quote: 
'Although this technique may have potential if further refined, the magnitude of the change is significantly smaller than would be expected if the effect depended on mass alone, and is not practical at the present time.'

He paused again. 
"That's 'researcher' for 'we couldn't get it to work _at all_', in case you were wondering."
And then, with a sarcastic grin, "Oh, someone's gonna use this to build a nuke-yoo-lar bomb. Haw haw haw."

"Get your heads out of your asses, this is the first really _new_ thing in science in like a decade and you want to shut it down?"

"I'm done here, we're ajourned." Marshall stood up and walked to the door.

"Mr. President, sir, what if they won't agree to our terms."

Marshall sighed. He hated that title.
"Well, I suggest you come up with better terms.
Because if you don't, I guarantee someone else will."
