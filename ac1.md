###**Phascolians**

Phascolians are a diasporadic species of dimorphic warm-blooded humanoids.
Healthy males born on the Phascolian home-world average 1.6 meters in height and mass around 50 kilograms, while females average 1.5 meters and around 45 kilograms.
(Note that these averages may be significantly different for populations from other worlds, but the galactic average is approximately the same.)

####Anatomy and Kinematics

Phascolians are bilaterally symmetrical, with an upright gait, [plantigrade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantigrade) feet, and five-fingered hands, one of which serves as an opposable thumb.
Their body proportions are similar to those of a Human.

####Biochemistry and Perception

While their chemical pathways are dramatically different from humans, they use many of the same underlying metabolic processes.
They have phospholipid cellular membranes, calciferous bones and teeth, and use and can digest most of the same sugars and fatty acids as humans.

While some compounds are used medicinally by both Humans and Phascolians, the vast majority of medications intended for one species will have little or no effect on the other, or will have dramatically different uses depending on the specific compound.

Likewise, many of the typical flavoring compounds used in food taste quite different to each species, and most especially strong flavorings used by one species will simply taste bitter to the other.
