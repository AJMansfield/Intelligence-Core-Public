Matt had finally given in: Magic was _complicated_.
Not really the "complicated" part, that wasn't up for debate;
  it was the "calling it magic" part that Matt had originally held out on.
This was very much **real** physics, and using that term felt improper.
But with no better name, heâ€™d eventually been pressured into it.

Whatever one called it though,
  the process of composing a "sigil" to create a desired "spell" was _decidedly_ nontrivial.

In an abstract sense least,
  each sigil was composed of a number of atomic units (dubbed "runes" over Matt's protest) arranged in a kind of tree structure,
  and there was a reasonably straightforward (if lengthy) procedure to render a rune tree to the actual sigil.
Mostly, it involved looking up each particular rune in a lengthy set of tables,
  determine which form to use from the list based on a few geometric and topological considerations,
  evaluate the listed formulae to figure out dimensions and stuff to get the physical geometry,
  and then repeat for all of the other runes and carefully compose everything together.
  
Simple, aside from a few edge cases.
Sometimes an entry might have more than one form listed,
  with a note indicating that you'd just need to try both and see what worked.
Some of the less-commonly-used runes had notes like,
  "no valid form for this configuration is known," for some parameter values,
  and you'd have to go back a few steps and try something else.
In general though, the process wasn't too difficult,
  and Matt had been working on ways of automating this.

The reverse transform,
  deriving the underlying rune tree of a rendered sigil,
  had so far proven much trickier.
There was a potential for aliasing issues where marks overlapped that made reverse-engineering difficult,
  and the tables they had weren't set up for doing quick reverse lookups,
  but it was at least possible, if time consuming.

It was the rune trees themselves that were the difficult part.

The problem was, the effect of a given spell wasn't determined by the tree itself;
  you couldn't simply add or remove individual runes or sections of the tree to customize it,
  that wasn't how it worked.
Instead, there were a number of "primitive" trees that were each associated with particular sorts of effects,
  and to actually create a rune tree for a given spell one had to "combine" these primitives together using a complex procedure,
  which according to Dr. Yang felt more like lattice cryptography than anything else.

While for small trees the procedure _was_ doable by hand,
  the complexity could quickly balloon as you added more primitives,
  and determining which primitives were used to construct an existing tree was essentially impossible short of sheer brute-force.

But that was not the real problem.

The _real problem_, was that none of what they had tried so far had _actually worked_.
They'd been able to copy sigils from some of Angela's equipment, and _those_ worked,
  but even directly following along with the textbook examples
  they had been entirely unable to construct a new sigil that had _any_ effect _at all_.  

Angela had insisted that she was "not an engineer" and didn't really know too much about constructing sigils,
  but she clearly knew at least enough to make _something_ work.
Even just a sigil that would get hot and catch fire &mdash;
  something Matt had personally witnessed Angela produce _on accident_ &mdash;
  was more than they had accomplished so far.

"So what's up?" Angela sat down at the table.
  Matt was here, as was the physics team lead from the meeting, and two other scientists she didn't recognise.

"We're not sure,"
  the team lead began.
"Oh, I'm Dr. Kyle House.
  This is Dr. Robert Canales, she's Dr. Marcia Goehring, and you're already familiar with Matt Boutwell,"
  he went around the table, quickly introducing everyone.

"Anyway, we've tried drawing up new sigils based on the books, but none of them work; they don't actually _do_ anything.
Not even the actual examples."

"Let me see."
Angela picked up a sheet of paper from the table and studied the sigil drawn on it.

Dr. Canales pulled up the translated scans of her spellbook on his tablet and slid it to her.
  "That one's supposed to be a helium lamp spell, following the example on page 46."

Helium lamps were one of the simplest "real" spells considered safe enough to teach beginners,
  and worked indirectly to produce light by pumping helium electrons to a higher energy state,
  which then emitted light as they relaxed back to the ground state.
Due to the finite relaxation time and the miniscule atmospheric helium concentration on most terrestrial planets,
  this put a hard upper limit on the maximum possible light output &mdash;
  on Earth, only about as much as a medium-wattage light bulb.

It was also one of the spells she was most familiar with due to its utility.
While you couldn't really make out colors under its light,
  it was still far better than no light at all.

"It at least _looks_ right," Angela began after looking over it for a few seconds.
"Maybe it's a precision issue?"
She hadn't actually measured anything yet,
  but this seemed unlikely since this had been drawn with a pen plotter rather than manually.
  
"Pass me the pen? &mdash; oh it's right here."
She'd just have to try to activate it and see what happened.

In any case this spell was pretty simple to activate,
  so she added the last few marks,
  and immediately the characteristic orangey-pink glow appeared.

"Seems like it works to me."

*Badr City, Egypt*

Jack and Mideple carefully moved into place inside the pod,
  and started work unscrewing the screws that should allow the instrument panel to hinge open.
It seemed nearly everything in this craft used left-handed bolts,
  and it took Jack actual effort to keep reminding himself which way he needed to turn the driver to get them out.

There were six cap screws in total along the top of the instrument panel that needed to be removed,
  and as they did so Kat deposited them into individually-labelled bags.
Once the last one was out, they braced against the panel to prevent it from accidentally falling,
  and ever-so-gently pulled back the top edge of the panel until it was nearly vertical.
Now that there was enough space to grab onto the panel's edge,
  they adjusted their grip,
  before slowly swinging the surprisingly-heavy panel down.
They lowered it until it was nearly level, where it stopped,
  coming to rest supported by an integrated support brace.<sup>[[something like this][support-brace]]</sup>

At this point they could see a whole mess of cables running from the backs of the various instruments and controls.
Most of the cables were glossy black,
  but there were also several in various shades of gray,
  and one or two in more vibrant colors like orange or purple.

At this point, Joyce passed Jack the camera she'd been using to film all this,
  and he carefully shined a light into the opening to get a proper view of what was going on.

Most of the cables ran back into the panel opening,
  the majority leading back and connecting to a long cylindrical device mounted towards the back of the cabinet.
It looked to be about 16cm in diameter and about 47cm long,
  and curiously it seemed to be made of a number of stacked metal segments of varying length,
  held together by a set of four long threaded rods running between two larger end-plates.

<sup>[[like this, except with cables attached to it][computer]]</sup>

Presumably this was the pod's computer, or at least some portion of the control system,
  as the majority of the instrument wires led directly to this device and attached to the sides of the different segments.

On closer examination the cables were more akin to plastic tubing than ordinary shielded cabling,
  with perfectly smooth glossy surfaces and quite a lot of springback when flexed.
They were also terminated at each end with what looked like _flare fittings_ of all things.
Flare fittings were normally used to provide a water- or air-tight seal,
  and didn't really make a lot of sense to use for an electrical connector.
  
Were these just pieces of conduit, with the actual wiring run inside them?
Perhaps whatever technology they used was simply a lot more sensitive to environmental factors,
  and the tubes were pressurized with an inert gas or something to prevent contamination.
That didn't seem too likely,
  but the possibility meant that disassembling things further
  without taking special precautions could potentially ruin the device.

It was also still a bit of a mystery why several of the instruments had four or five separate conduit runs to the computer,
  rather than one larger-diameter run.
There clearly _had_ larger-diameter conduit available, since it was used elsewhere in this mess.
But if each cable did only carry a single conductor,
  that didn't really explain the gauges that only had a single connection.
  
The cables squished far too easily between his fingers to be coax,
  or at least any sort of coax he was familiar with.
Perhaps a return path through a chassis ground?
There weren't any particular provisions for ensuring a good ground across the instrument panel hinges though;
  he would have expected at least a small earthing strap or something if this was the case.

Was this _pneumatic_?
The hosing and connectors made sense in that case,
  but for crying out loud this was the _instrument panel!_

For now though, he fetched his micrometer and carefully measured the flare nuts and other fasteners.
While they had already ordered custom box-end wrenches and sockets for most of the sizes based on the drawings,
  they hadn't thought to order flare nut wrenches, and they weren't going to be taking any chances on stripping fasteners.

"Looks like you two were right, there is something we were missing,"
  Dr. House said, indicating Matt and Dr. Canales.
"Can you explain exactly what you're doing to make the sigil function?"

Angela tweaked one of her ears to the side, in an expression about equivalent to furrowing one's brow.
"Uh... I'm not sure what you mean. That sigil at least was perfectly fine; all I did was activate it."

"I'm talking about the additional marks you made, just now. How does that work?"

Matt broke in. "So far we've only been directly following what the book says, is there some step we're missing here?"

"I mean, well..." 
Angela added another mark to the sigil, and the light disappeared.
"So the book isn't going to tell you how to activate the sigil, you still have to do that yourself."

"Ok, but what do you actually _do?_"

Angela picked up another page and slid it in front of Matt, passing him the pen.
"Ok, look, you just need to do it. Look at the sigil, and draw in the activation marks."

There was a momentary pause, before Matt responded,
  "ok but like what do I even draw in?
  How do _you_ know what to draw?"

Angela really wasn't sure how to describe it.
"It's like, if you're looking at a face, you don't see the individual lines and shadows that make up the face, you just see the face."

There was another, longer pause, before Dr. Goehring broke the silence.
"Or, perhaps, after Dr. Hill's discovery a few days ago, more like subitization."

"Yeah, like that."
