Matt collapsed back in his chair, defeated.
He'd been awake for 43 hours at this point, and he was essentially out of options.
If he wanted to have anything at all to show for in 8 hours at the competition, he needed to start the compiler now.

This year's undergraduate robotics competition involved autonomously navegating an underwater maze to retrieve a simulated submarine escape pod.

His responsibility had been designing the navegation system used to get to the pod, and he'd chosed to base the design on a species of pufferfish, _Torquigener tetraodontidae_, known for constructing [large circular geometric patterns][pufferfish] underwater in order to attract potential mates.
Neural simulations based on aquatic animals generally performed very well in this type of environment, and it stood to reason that this pufferfish might be especially suited due to it's apparent ability to process complicated geometric patterns.

So far he'd been able to successfully abstract out the pufferfish's motor cortex and get it to control the UAV's thrusters, but no matter what he'd tried he hadn't been able to figure out it's visual cortex or sensory mechanisms.
He could potentially just simulate the pufferfish brain directly, but usually that took a lot of processing power, and he wasn't sure if the UAV's processor would be able to handle it.

At this point, he just had to hope the compiler would be able to optimize it enough to at least _work_, even if it couldn't run fast enough to be competitive.

Dejectedly, he set it running, and fell asleep in his chair.

Matt awoke with a start to sunlight streaming in onto his face.
He checked the time - 12:30 - and started scrolled through his notifications before suddenly remembering he needed to be at the competition in 15 minutes.

He hastily grabbed the UAV and stuffed it in his bag with his laptop, only sparing a glance to ensure everything had compiled, before running as quickly as he could from the Computer Science Department to the Richards Building pool where the competition was being held.

"You got it figured out?" Jessica called to him as he arrived panting to the competition area.

"I ... I think so?" Matt gasped, trying to catch his breath.
The optimization report had said it had managed to fit the simulation onto the UAV's processor.
He pulled the UAV out of his bag and handed it to her.
"It will work, I'm pretty sure."

Jessica had been responsible for the mechanical design of the project, and she'd also been the one to who'd gotten him the neural scan he'd used as a basis for the programming.

"Mike messaged me and he should be here in - nnng there he is." she said, turning as she spotted Mike making his way through the light crowd.

Mike had done a lot of the electrical design, but more importantly he had also been the one who'd gotten most of their funding &mdash; apparently his uncle had made an absurd amount of money off the "bitcoin boom" in the thirties, and was only too glad to use some of it to help fund his nephiew's education.

"Hey we ready?" he asked once he'd gotten to them.

Matt nodded. "Let's go."
