*Cairo, Egypt*

Solomon arrived at the NARECO executive office an hour before the scheduled meeting, and went over his notes as he waited.
He was scheduled to appear before an executive board to present business data from the Coral Sound program
  and argue for an extension of its charter.

The response to the video series had been much stronger than he'd expected,
  and after some pressure he'd allowed Joyce to start publishing portions of the scans to their patreon.
The community had actually managed to make some progress toward understanding portions of the text;
  in particular they'd worked out how the alien number system worked,
  and had identified one of the charts in the navigation manual as a periodic table.
This in turn had led to a _number_ of things,
  such as figuring out how to decode alloy specifications from the drawings,
  and finally being able to work out the exact conversion from xeno units to metric and back.

Solomon was still keeping an eye on things though to ensure they didn't fall afoul of weapons technology laws.
The main concern was the pod's propulsion system:
  given the presence of a flight stick in the cabin,
  it was reasonable to assume the pod had at minimum some form of attitude control.
Indeed, Mideple _had_ managed to get the pod to rock very slightly side-to-side during one of their power-up tests
  by moving the stick back and forth,
  although they hadn't been able to reproduce it since.

As such, they were still only releasing scans of the mechanical drawings for components or assemblies that were obviously benign,
  such as various fasteners, gaskets, the docking collar, doors, seats, etc.
  or after thoroughly examining the corresponding section of the pod to determine its function.

This sort of gradual release seemed to work in their favor, however,
  as each new release helped keep the community engaged.
The patreon had turned out to be a much larger source of revenue than Solomon had expected;
  in fact, they were very nearly reaching the break-even point for revenue vs operating expenses
  if you didn't count loan repayments or interest.

As such, and given that the preliminary audit hadn't turned up anything negative,
  the odds that the executive board would decline to extend a program
  that was _this_ close to profitability _this_ early on was next to zero,
  although Solomon was still nervous given the true nature of this particular program.

_Relax.
You've gotten programs through that were sketchier than a hobo selling watches at Montmartre, there's nothing to worry about.
This meeting is mostly just a formality at this point._

**American Airlines Flight 669**  
*PHX -> DCA*

> _Ladies and gentlemen, as we start our descent,
  please make sure your seat backs and tray tables are in their full upright position.
Make sure your seat belt is securely fastened
  and all carry-on luggage is stowed underneath the seat in front of you or in the overhead bins.
Thank you._

As the plane began its decent,
  Angela finished up on her laptop and put it away.
Due to her smaller size even "economy" seats on a human plane were reasonably comfortable for her,
  but the extra room afforded by business class _did_ make it a lot easier to get useful work done.
Plus, it was on the company dime so it wasn't like the massively oversized seat cost _her_ anything.

Three years.
That was how long she'd agreed to work with the humans, after which, assuming things went well she'd be able to leave this planet.

The top priority right now was building a suitable replacement landing pod
  to mate with the Carina &mdash;
  although it had never had it's own name before this point,
  they couldn't very well keep referring to it as "the interstellar stage"
  so this was the name they'd agreed on.
Likewise they'd settled on "Auriga 1" for the orbital descent pod she'd used to land here,
  and which was now in the hands of the Coral Sound group;
  iterations on the replacement pod would then be "Auriga 2", "Auriga 3", and so forth.

Once the humans were able to safely dock with the Carina,
  the agreement was that they would work to refurbish and resupply it
  to the point where she'd be able to use it to travel to another system.

Then, once _that_ milestone was achieved,
  she'd agreed to allow them to use the Carina for short-range test flights
  and to assist with efforts to non-destructively reverse-engineer it,
  for whatever was left of the three years.

> _Ladies and gentlemen, we have just been cleared to land.
Please make sure one last time your seat belt is securely fastened.
The flight attendants are currently passing around the cabin for the final check and to pick up any remaining cups and glasses.
Thank you._

Angela had made this flight nearly every other week for the last six months,
  and she always made sure to book a left-hand window seat.
As she shifted over to the window the plane finally broke through the cloud layer,
  revealing the lights of the city below.

[image](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0fpILAbQqAI/maxresdefault.jpg)

She'd seen it a dozen times, and while it had lost some of the magic from that first flight in,
  seeing this city and its monuments all lit up in the night was still an awe-inspiring sight.

The plane finished the descent and touched down on the runway with a soft bump.
The roar of the airbrakes filled the plane as its rapid deceleration pulled Angela forward, and finally the plane came to a stop.

> _Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.
Local time is 8:03 pm and the temperature is 76 degrees.
For your safety and comfort, please remain seated with your seat belt fastened until the Captain turns off the Fasten Seat Belt sign.
This will indicate that we have parked at the gate and that it is safe for you to move about._
>
> _On behalf of American Airlines and the entire crew,
  I’d like to thank you for joining us on this trip and we are looking forward to seeing you on board again in the near future.
Have a nice evening!_

Ian was tired.
As the VP in charge of their work with Angela and this new "sigil" technology,
  his main job was coordinating the various research groups to ensure everyone's time &mdash;
  and in particular, _Angela's_ time &mdash; was used effectively.
With six months of the original three years already gone,
  each additional delay or hiccup ate into the already-limited time they'd have with the Carina
  and the advanced propulsion and life support systems that enabled it to cross the vast distances of space.

The weeks leading up to today had been particularly hectic.
Auriga 2 was scheduled for a test launch out of Vandenberg later this week,
  and he'd been stretching nearly to his limit
  coordinating everything to ensure the launch went smoothly.
Now though, the prototype pod sat awaiting launch in its fairing,
  the Vulcan IV underneath it secured atop the launch pad,
  and there was surprisingly little left for Ian to do as they counted down the last few days to the launch.

So, just for tonight, Ian was taking a break.

He'd been invited to a charity fundraiser event along with his wife.
Rumor had it the president might even be there later,
  although this was a fairly transparent attempt to increase the event's perceived importance.
Whoever'd started that rumor should've probably gone for something else if if they'd wanted anyone to take it seriously;
  _this_ president was notorious for having _entirely stopped_ attending these sorts of events the moment he'd been elected.

In any case though,
  there were certainly plenty of other important individuals at this event.
  including a few he'd recognized as he entered.
And it wasn't long before he in turn was recognized.

"Hey, Ian!
Heard you've got a launch just next week.
You only picked up that SigilTek company, what? Seven, eight months ago?
What's the rush?"
This was Kenneth Marks, VP at Raytheon and
  one of Ian's biggest bidding rivals for government contracts.

"Well unlike _some_ people, I'm not one to just sit on ass until you guys manage to steal our tech yourselves.
Once we're launching cargo to space for pennies on the ton then we can talk from my private island."

"Ooh, bold claims given all _I've_ seen are those party favors y'all were handing out a few months ago."

"Party favors that have already _completely_ undercut you on that ultralite recon drone proposal you'd been hawking for ages.
Don't worry, we'll still license it to you for an exorbitant fee once we're good and ready."

So far, Solomon's presentation had gone pretty much exactly as planned, although there had been two surprises.
One, since this was a general commerce board rather than one associated with his old department,
  he hadn't expected to see anyone he even recognized much less knew;
  as such seeing one of his old associates, Athir Usama, on the board had been a bit of a surprise.
Most likely he'd managed to weasel his way onto this board for the spectacle,
  although it's possible he could've left the intelligence department in a lateral career move and was here legitimately.

The second surprise had actually been how _easy_ it had been.
He was used to having to argue tooth and nail for his projects,
  but apparently the revenue figures they'd posted were impressive enough that there was no convincing needed.

"Any other questions?"
He expected they might have a few token questions but nothing serious.

"I've got one."
Athir spoke up.
"You'd always been opposed to hoaxes and this sort of thing, even back before you retired. Why the change of heart?"

"I mean, this is a rather different thing than my previous intelligence work.
I'm not actually trying to deceive anyone with these documentaries, this is just entertainment."

"Hmm, let me try again.
So, after you retired you made it sort of your _thing_, to go around debunking other people's "alien encounter" stories.
Including other things that were _also_ "just entertainment".
Now you're making a complete U-turn and are producing your own "alien spaceship" story, why?"

"Uhh, that's not quite ... I mean I guess at first?
But really that was mostly just the character I played,
  and now that I've come across the opportunity that's part of what's let me get so far this quickly."
Still not _technically_ a lie at this point.

"I see, you've thought this out."
Athir paused, before reaching down to his leather bag to pull out a stack of photographs.

"The rest of you can go now, by the way."
Athir casually dismissed the other board members with a wave,
  leaving the two of them alone as he spread the photographs out on the table.

"These were taken yesterday morning showing launch preparations at Vandenberg Air Force Base in the US.
Business as usual.

"But."
He picked out one photograph in particular, showing a work crew mounting a payload
  that bore striking similarities to the craft Solomon had found all those months ago,
  the one now sitting in his warehouse.

"Let me cut to the chase.
How, _exactly_, did you come by your supposed "alien spaceship"?"

**Farragut West Metro Station**
*Washington DC*

Angela stepped off the train out into the underground train station,
  the distinctive faint musky smell evident as the reverberations from the train's arrival quickly tapered off.
While she could've easily taken a car from the airport to her apartment &mdash;
  never mind a taxi, if she'd wanted it the she could've been picked up by a company chauffeur and ridden in a limousine &mdash;
  she'd recently taken to using public transit just out of preference.

The regular change of scenery between DC and California had majorly improved her stress levels,
  but after six months of this she was starting to get _too_ comfortable,
  the familiarity starting to chafe.
The level of independence public transit afforded her and the chance encounters it provided helped break up the familiarity enough
  for her to not feel overly anxious about the need to "move on".

The old lady she'd been talking to on the train stepped off behind her carrying her little dog she had with her.
Apparently this woman owned several other small dogs and regularly took them to shows to compete.
Angela hadn't quite understood all of the details since she'd only started learning mandarin for fun a few weeks ago,
  but it had been surprisingly interesting nonetheless and in any case a good chance to practice speaking the language.

"Mànzŏu. ^<sup>(Take care.)</sup>" the woman called to Angela as she passed.

"Zhù nĭ hăoyùn! ^<sup>(Good luck!)</sup>" she called back.
"Hope you do well!"

Angela stood for a few more moments before exiting, making her way up the escalators to the street.
It was only a three minute walk across the square to Farragut North
  to get on the train that would take her the rest of the way,
  but Angela was in no particular rush,
  and it felt good to be able to walk across the open square and get a breath of fresh air.

Marshal _hated_ these sorts of events.
All the wealthy pigs, all gathered together in one place with their tinkling champagne glasses and bankrupt morals.
Perhaps that was a little unfair,
  he'd had to play the game himself to get to where he was,
  but any way you sliced it it was certainly an "ethically diverse" crowd.

He'd forced himself to attend _this_ ~~money-laundering extravaganza~~ ahem, "fundraiser",
  for one purpose, and one purpose only.

Any hope of maintaining a low profile was of course instantly destroyed the moment he arrived.
Even without his entourage he would have been recognized fairly quickly,
  but the need for the secret service escort was probably one of the most inconvenient things about his position.
In any case though, they _were_ still useful,
  and before long one of his staff found and relayed to him the location of his target.

It took an _excruciating_ half-hour to make his way there,
  fending off thinly-veiled and sometimes not-so-thinly-veiled offers to buy his support for this, that, or the other thing.
He'd made the decision early on in his term that he wouldn't be running for reelection;
  corruption be damned, he was beholden to none but God and the American people.
But as much as he would have liked to tell each and every one of them exactly which orifice to shove their offer up,
  he still couldn't afford to alienate the rich and powerful of this city
  if he hoped to be able to continue to advance his own objectives.

Finally though, he found his target: Mr. Ian Marcantel, VP at Lockheed Martin.

"So ... you're the one who landed the partnership with SigilTek."
It had been no big secret that he was interested in the company's new technology,
  and he had a reputation of being very much to the point,
  so this shouldn't have seemed too unusual.
Well, more than him being here in the first place.
"You haven't really released anything yet though."

Starting off with an easy not-technically-a-question.

"Well, uh," Mr. Marcantel was clearly a bit on edge talking to him, which suited Marshall fine.
"We're still developing the technology, we don't really have anything that's ready to productize yet.
For the moment we're keeping things proprietary."

He then added after a moment, "Mr. President, sir."

"Fair enough, Ian, can I call you Ian?"
Marshall paused for a moment, pretending to contemplate while carefully observing the man.

"So, Ian, what do you know about aliens?" he queried,
  pausing _just_ long enough to observe the man _twitch_ slightly before following up.
"My analysts tell me immigration's likely to be an important topic for the next election, thought I'd get your stance on it."

He'd been able to figure out that Lockheed had something _extra_ unusual going on,
  but whatever it was they were running a pretty tight ship keeping it under wraps.
The reason he'd started with "aliens" was because it was, if wrong,
  the least likely to put the Lockheed VP on guard to start watching his statements.
He hadn't expected this response at all.

Up until now this had still only been one of several hypothetical conjectures,
  the man's reaction as he prepared to respond confirmed it &mdash; or something close, anyway.

"Well, we don't really employ many foreigners,"
  Mr. Marcantel admitted after he'd finished recovering.
"Most of our contracts doesn't allow us to use non-citizens for national security reasons."

"Ah yes. My mistake."
Marshall wasn't sure exactly how much the man suspected he knew at this point,
  but he was obviously being a lot more careful now;
  trying to indirectly weasel anything else important from him would likely be an excercise in futility at this point.

It was time to get a bit more direct.

"I need to talk to you. In private."

The president leaned in.

"This is about ... _Angela_."

Angela paused her phone and set down her sketchpad,
  pulling out her earbuds to look around.
Something didn't feel right.
