A thousand kilometers above the planet's surface,
  the small Auriga 4 capsule drifted the last few meters between it and the much larger Carina mothership.

Various controllers called out statuses over the comms.

"Separation zero point two."

"Latch trigger armed."

"Zero point one."

"RCS to drift."

"Contact."

There was a soft scraping noise, and Angela heard the sharp clack over her headset
  as the latching fingers caught on the inside of Carina's docking ring.

At this moment, Angela was sitting at a desk in a small control room in Palmdale, California,
  halfway across the country from main mission control in Centennial, Colorado.
  
The primary objective of Auriga 4 was to test the reverse-engineered docking fixture and docking procedure,
  to verify they were able to safely dock with and enter Carina,
  or in the alternative determine what changes needed to be made to ensure future missions would succeed.
The previous mission, Auriga 3, had successfully docked with a test target the humans had built,
  but this had only let them test the tolerances on the capture and mechanical docking procedures.

Once they had secured a hard mechanical connnection &mdash; assuming they were able to &mdash;
  they would assess the condition of Carina's docking hatch to determine whether and how to open it safely.
If possible, they would then use a robotic vehicle to enter the craft, and retrieve Carina's flight manuals.

"Latch trigger OK."

"Standby to confirm capture," the mission conductor declared,
  and began polling the different roles for their go/no-go determination
  on whether to proceed with the attempt.

"V. C."  &mdash; "Go."

"Propulsion" &mdash; "Go."

The craft they were attempting to dock with was quite literally irreplaceable,
  the only such craft within light-years of Earth.
Above all else, one of the top priorities for the mission was avoiding damage to Carina,
  and if there was any doubt about whether it was safe to proceed,
  they were going to back off, reassess, and hopefully try again,
  either on this mission or the next one.

"Avionics" &mdash; "Go."

"Radiation" &mdash; "Go."

Angela wasn't directly involved in controlling the craft or any direct mission functions,
  rather, her role was to provide translations of any text, labels, or other markings as they were encountered,
  and provide input on how to proceed based on her experience with the craft.
While they had gone over nearly every aspect of the craft in discussions and training sessions,
  it was inevitable that some details had been overlooked,
  and Angela scanned her camera feeds to make sure everything matched up with what she remembered.

"Survey One" &mdash; "Go."

"Survey Two" &mdash; "Go."

These were the two surveillance satellites that had been moved into orbits near Carina nearly from the beginning of the program,
  which were now also being used to monitor the docking procedure.

She was next.

"X-TOE" &mdash;

Everything matched up. "Go."

The conductor continued down the checklist, finally reaching the last few.

"Mission Manager" &mdash; "Go."

"Chief Engineer" &mdash; "Go."

"Flight Director" &mdash;

There was a tense moment as the flight director gave final approval. "I say go."

"Ok. We are GO for retraction!"

There was a brief pause,
  and then a rapid series of clacks resonated through the craft and over Angela's headset as the docking latches retracted,
  clamping the docking ports firmly together to hopefully form an airtight seal.

Several more statuses were called out,
  and after a few more minutes of activity,
  nobody had needed to call an abort.

"And, we're docked!"

**Lockheed-Martin Skunkworks Division**  
*Palmdale, California*

Angela stretched her arm out and flexed her shoulder,
  working through her full range of motion to test out the latest iteration of her mockup flight suit.

Between the various loose-fitting clothing styles and stretchy elastic textiles available,
  ordinary mass-produced clothing had to this point served Angela adequately.
But the stiff protective fabrics used in flight suits demanded a more accurate fit,
  and she needed several: both for training and for actual use in the upcoming manned missions into space.

Convergent evolution had left phascolians and humans with very similar body plans,
  but there were a number of differences that meant she couldn't simply use a suit manufactured for a human.
The most obvious was size &mdash; at four feet six inches tall and only 74 pounds,
  even the smallest human astronaut had been a full head taller and significantly larger than her.

But beyond the need for a custom size,
  many human joints and axes of motion were slightly offset from where they were on her own species,
  and their skin often deformed differently in response to movement.
She could probably _physically_ put on a suit designed for a human were it scaled down to her size,
  but such a suit would chafe and bind in unexpected ways, and limit her range of motion.

"Better, but it's still rubbing a bit right ... here," Angela indicated a spot near one shoulder.

"Hmm... bend your arm forward again? Ok, and back."

She complied as the suit technician carefully examined it, and adjusted a few clips to tweak the fit.

"Try it again."

Angela flexed the joint again, and confirmed. "Yeah, it feels better, although it's still a bit tight on my forearm."

"Hmm." 

He felt around where Angela had indicated, then reached behind her back and tugged on something.
Immediately the pressure on her forearm evened out.

"Ok, looks like I just need to put in a longer seam _there_ to hold the piece flat."

The tech motioned for Angela to take off the suit so he could stitch it up,
  and she complied, unzipping the suit and stepping out.

She still had on her undergarment &mdash;
  basically a pair of spandex bicycle shorts that came up to just below her ribs &mdash;
  but as she glanced over towards the corner where her bodyguard stood she still felt exposed.
  
Nudity didn't bother her at all the same way it seemed to bother humans;
  she had no inhibitions about discussing phascolian anatomy and bodily functions with the human scientists,
  and she regularly used her own medical imagery and photographs to illustrate discussions.
She'd seen more than enough medical nudity in her own career anyway,
  and the only _real_ sense in which it bothered her was the subtle narcissism of being the only example subject,
  and the unavoidable implication that she was somehow a "typical" or "default" instance of her species.
  
And while it would take a special sort of pervert
  to actually _enjoy_ being fully naked in an exam room with a medical photographer,
  at this point she trusted the research teams' professionalism.
It definitely wasn't the same as being naked _in front of people_.

After the incident four months ago where she'd been mugged,
  Angela had been forced to accept having a bodyguard.
There'd been a big procedural kerfuffle following the incident,
  up to an including a meeting with the President of the United States.
Among other things he'd practically _lectured_ her about how she had a "responsibility"
  to &mdash; paraphrasing a bit &mdash; put up with being followed everywhere by a squad of security thugs.

Needless to say, it hadn't seemed like they'd be willing to continue to accept a "no" for an answer,
  and Angela had been forced to agree to let Lockheed supply personal security for her when she was out in public.

At the time, her immediate emotional need for more security made giving up that small bit of personal liberty seem worthwhile,
  but more and more it seemed Benjamin Franklin had been right.
At some level, it _had_ initially helped her feelings of insecurity, but the initial shock and trauma wore off quickly,
  and this was now a significant source of stress for her.

Before the incident, she'd frequently spent time visiting unfamiliar areas of the city and talking to strangers,
  as a way to help manage the stress of living and working in the same few locations for so long.
But having a bodyguard shadowing her every move in public had nearly defeated the point of the exercise,
  making her feel like she was being stalked.
Or that that they were there to stop her, if she tried to travel beyond some arbitrary limit.

She rarely went out for long periods anymore.

At least she didn't normally need a bodyguard
  when she was home in one of her apartments, or inside the secure areas where she usually worked.
And, not that it mattered,
  but there _were_ a few spots she'd identified that would make that easy &mdash; or at least, easier &mdash;
  to ditch her bodyguard, if she ever needed to.
It probably wouldn't them long to catch up if she did,
  but the thought did give her a little comfort.

The suit technician finished stitching up the modifications and handed the suit back to her,
  which she gratefully put back on and started moving again to test it.

Depending on the outcome of the next couple of missions,
  the current plan was for her to go up on Auriga 8, four months from now.
Carina was in a highly eccentric inclined retrograde orbit with a period just under two weeks,
  and they were launching a new mission to it every other orbit.

They'd made the decision early on to go manned as early as possible,
  as soon as they were confident it was safe.
Out at apogee, there would be a round trip delay of nearly four seconds,
  limiting how quickly a remotely-controlled robot could be operated,
  and even the best robots were nowhere near as versatile as a human &mdash; or phascolian, as it were.

There were plans on the table to also send up human astronauts at some point &mdash;
  to perform tasks outside Carina and provide local control for any robotics &mdash;
  but due to size constraints of the small docking opening,
  Angela was the only real candidate for any manned mission that would involve physically entering Carina.
  
Sending her up in person before any humans was also one of the conditions Lockheed had agreed to for this project.

To that end, much of Angela's time over the last few months had been spent in training and simulations,
  learning how to use human avionics and flight control systems.
While she was already familiar with spaceflight in general and how to operate Carina &mdash;
  given she'd had to fly herself here in it after all &mdash;
  they'd made the decision to base as much as possible on the same technology used in the human's existing Orion capsule,
  rather than attempt to make a one-to-one copy of the original Auriga capsule.

The overall aerodynamic shape was still original &mdash;
  that particular shape was specifically designed to enable landings
  on the widest possible range of planets with the widest possible range of atmospheres,
  rather than optimized specifically for Earth &mdash;
  and of course they'd made exact replicas of the docking mechanism and the other components meant to interface with Carina,
  but this meant she had to spend a significant amount of time training on the new craft.

There were a number of technical reasons behind the decision to ditch the original design,
  but it mostly came down to the fact that they wouldn't be able to easily
  reproduce any components of the craft that required specific spells to function.
The schematics for the craft of course didn't include any of the actual sigil artwork implementing the required spells,
  only specifications for what the spells the sigils on each of the round ceramic plates needed to do.

Angela had a basic understanding of the theory and could cast simple spells,
  but many of the spells required were far beyond anything she could do.
And while the human efforts in understanding magic had apparently made some progress,
  they were still nowhere near being able to cast even very basic practical spells themselves.
At best they'd been able to create a handful of _deeply uncanny looking_
  sigils that were apparently just barely detectable by their arrays of sensitive detectors.

The other option, trying to recover the original sigil artwork from Solomon and his team somehow,
  wasn't any good either.
Commercial prints of sigils used for engineering applications 
  were usually coated with a tamper-resistant lacquer over the artwork,
  precisely to prevent that sort of reverse-engineering.
On top of that, even if Solomon and his team could somehow recover the artwork for all of the sigils,
  they couldn't risk using a sigil that had been published publicly.
  
Case in point, the paper airplane sigil that _they'd_ published early on
  had only continued to rise in popularity after it went viral,
  right up until a month and a half ago when it burned out, years ahead of when they'd originally expected.
The same thing could easily happen if someone identified another published sigil as such.
Having a key sigil burn out on the ground would be significant setback.
Having it burn out while she was in the air would be a disaster.

The technician took the suit back after making some more adjustments,
  and the two of them repeated the process several more times.

The one they were working with was just a template, but once the fit was finalized
  it would be used to manufacture a handful of different flight jumpsuits, plus a liner for an EVA space suit.
At present there wasn't an EVA for her _planned_, but depending on the state of Carina it might be necessary,
  and the lead time for manufacturing a space suit was significant.

While she waited for the technician to finalize another modification,
  Angela pulled out her phone, trying to distract herself from her discomfort.
She'd taken up reading a lot of human fiction as another avenue for helping manage her stress.
Initially she'd used an e-reader for most of her reading &mdash; and still did &mdash;
  but she'd found the tactile aspects of physical books themselves also soothing,
  and had started regularly ordering books from Amazon.

Hardcover books especially weren't exactly cheap,
  but Lockheed was paying her a fairly large salary on top of the other aspects of the deal,
  and it wasn't like she had anything else to spend it on.
Nobody else in the galaxy would care how much Earth currency she had stockpiled in a bank light years away,
  and if all went to plan, in just over two years it wouldn't matter to her either.

She scrolled through her phone, passing various listings and recommendations,
  adding a few books.
For whatever reason she felt vaguely intrigued by a listing for a bundle of paracord.
She wasn't sure what about it was intriguing &mdash; maybe the bright color? There were some interesting color options,
  although digital photos never looked quite the same as the real thing to her due to differences in color vision.

Ah, what the heck.
It was cheap, and if buying random nick-nacks helped her stress levels then so be it.
Although at the same time, as she added a bundle of black paracord to the cart there was also a vague twinge of embarrassment,
  and she couldn't help but glance over at her bodyguard as she ordered and paid for everything.

Whatever. Not like any of it made any sense anyway.

"So, yeah, I was about 28"&mdash;
  Angela paused as she did some mental math &mdash;
  "that'd be somewhere around ninteen of your years, old,
  when I finally got off Kemhe."

"Kemhe" was what Angela had settled on as a reasonable English approximation of the name of her birth planet.
It was the smaller more-recently-colonized of the two main inhabited planets in the system, the other being "Limhe".
She'd also decided on a better name to use for her species at least for informal purposes,
  since "Phascolian" was a bit of a mouthful, and a bit anatomical for casual conversation.

As species exonyms went, "Kender" was a pretty good one,
  without _too_ many connotations, and not all of them necessarily bad.
It was an existing term borrowed from the human's own fiction,
  and that meant it would be a lot more likely to stick long term, too.
It sure beat out most exonyms from her native language,
  which usually had _very_ derogatory meanings if you went back far enough in the etymology.
A few of the "newer" ones, translated literally, meant things like "incest bugs" or "idiot-language speakers".

"Anyway, my ... what's a good term for it? dowry? inheritance?
I guess "birthright" is probably the closest conceptually.
Basically, the large gift from your parent's colony before you leave home for the last time.

"Usually it includes some amount of money, although not necessarily;
  livestock is a pretty common in more rural areas and a lot of colonies have other "traditional" gifts that they include.
But, basically, the stuff you get after whatever final coming-of-age ceremony your colony makes you do,
  after which you're considered to be on your own,
  and finally get to leave and never come back."

Angela paused as the agent across from her made a few notes.

Now that the federal government &mdash; or at least parts of it &mdash;
  were aware that she was in fact an extraterrestrial,
  she and Lockheed had been forced to make some concessions in order to prevent the feds from interfering with the project.
Accepting a bodyguard was one of them,
  letting the CIA interview her was another.

For the most part they were interested in understanding what kind of military threat other star systems posed
  and how to deal with it,
  although part of it was also about developing a "proper" first contact policy
  for the _next_ time Earth had to deal with extraterrestrials &mdash; kender or otherwise.

Today, she was being interviewed by Agent Gallegos,
  accompanied by another agent Angela hadn't met before.
She also had an anthropologist from Lockheed's team, Carlos Bianco,
  since a lot of this material would be of interest to both groups.
  
Her bodyguard &mdash; today, a large man named Neil Buono &mdash; stood as inconspicuously as possible in the corner,
  although there was nothing inconspicuous about him.
Angela had made an effort to overcome her feelings of apprehension by talking with him,
  and learning that he had a wife and 4-month old baby at home had helped a bit,
  but Angela still couldn't feel comfortable.
She tried to push it from her mind and focused on the interview at hand.

Angela didn't really know much about military matters beyond her own experience,
  but as far as she knew, war basically wasn't a thing over interstellar distances.
Not that it necessarily hadn't happened _ever_, but it was definitely very rare.
There just wasn't any point,
  and it would just be foolish to try to fight an enemy with an entire planetful of resources at their disposal
  on supply chains that could take literally decades to move resources to the front.

This hadn't really seemed to comfort the agents,
  and they'd continued asking her everything she knew about the military technology available,
  but she just really didn't know.

For instance: were near-lightspeed torpedoes a thing?
Sure, the concept existed in kender sci-fi too, and it seemed like it might be plausible,
  but she hadn't ever seen one or heard of one being used _except_ in fiction.

Eventually, after the first two sessions had gone nowhere,
  they'd just decided to let her tell her story so they could get some idea of where to start.

"Anyway, I was actually already living _mostly_ independently at that point,
  and had used a connection I'd made earlier with the manager of an orbital freight company
  to bargain for passage to orbit for a little less than a quarter of what I'd expected I'd be getting,
  in exchange for agreeing to work at one of her company's freight yards until I was able to secure something better.

"Normally I'd have been able to leave earlier than that,
  but one of the members of my cohort had been born with some learning disorder and really wasn't ready to live on his own,
  and wasn't until _another_ of my cohort got fed up and just left _without_ their dowry
  that the tribe _finally_ decided to let the rest of us move on without him.
  
"Honestly it was a pretty big embarrassment all around,
  I'd have already left too I hadn't neeeded the money to be able to buy my way into space.
  
"But anyway they finally agreed to do it, I got the money &mdash;
  the boy's mother was still salty about the whole thing and refused to participate
  so it was a bit less than I'd hoped, although combined with what I'd saved it was still more than enough &mdash;
  and I was on the next shuttle to orbit that afternoon."

She paused for a moment, and Carlos broke in.
"You say it was a "big embarrassment all around". Can you elaborate on what you mean?"

Angela wiggled her ears slightly before pushing down the feeling.
It wasn't like these humans were going to judge her for this, she didn't need to feel embarrassed in front of them.

For a kender, the idea of a fully-grown adult living under the same roof
  with their parent colony was considered borderline incest,
  and even living in the same city could sometimes be considered somewhat improper.
In Angela's case, for nearly a year or so after first feeling the pull to leave
  (that she'd been forced to ignore due to colony politics),
  she'd technically been living within only a few minutes walk of her parent colony.

This hadn't been by choice:
  the fact of the matter was there was very limited real estate and housing available
  in a domed frontier settlement, even the comparatively large one she'd grown up in.

At the time, the whole experience had simply been stressful, 
  but in retrospect the idea that she'd just _waited_ there for nearly a year,
  ignoring the call to leave and waiting around for a handout, felt wrong and immoral.

"Ok." Carlos confirmed, after Angela finished explaining this.
"You also said it was an embarrassment "all around",
  I assume you mean this was in some way embarrassing for the colony as well?"

Angela snorted, using an expression she'd learned from the humans.
"Yeah, alright.
Part of that is just the fact of having a "disabled" child at all, and the stigma associated with it.
Never mind the statistics about it and the fact his particular condition wasn't even anything genetic,
  people are just shit, same as they are here or anywhere.

"The main part though was _Leunnel_ &mdash;"
Angela pronounced the name in her native dialect &mdash; "Leon" was probably a reasonable approximation in English.
""Leon" is probably a reasonable approximation in English &mdash;
  anyway, after he ran off with no ceremony and no dowry.

"The thing to understand,
  is that the whole ceremony and dowry gifts are as much about politicking and showing off wealth to other colonies,
  as they are about actually letting us leave to start our own lives.

"As such, having him just run off was actually a bit of a scandal for them,
  and gave rise to all kinds of rumors.
Probably the most charitable being that colony had fallen on hard times financially or was near bankrupt,
  but there were plenty of rumors alleging various degrees of impropriety.
  
"I never really cared much about colony politics,
  but at least that was able to pressure them into finally going ahead,"
  Angela finished.

Carlos asked a few more questions after that, but eventually he was satisfied and Angela resumed her story.

"But yeah, it was working in the orbital freight yard where I got most of my experience with spaceflight,
  learning how to maneuver orbital tugs to move containers around, to load and unload the large carriers
  and accurately de-orbit shipments intended for the surface."

"What sort of shipments?" Agent Gallegos asked.
The other CIA agent was also clearly quite interested.

"Uh... to and from the planet...
there was usually a lot of industrial equipment being shipped in
  &mdash; machine tools, farm equipment, engines, that sort of thing.
Some scientific and medical stuff too.
Chemicals, pesticides and the like,
  some amount of raw materials &mdash; metals, steel and aluminum; also plastics.
Those were more often intended for manufacturing hubs in orbit near the planet rather than the surface.

"_From_ the surface, mostly it was food of one kind or another.
Grain, but also also refined foodstuffs - salt, sugar, starches, refined oils and fats.
Sometimes pre-packed or prepared food, vegetables, meat.
Those shipments were usually meant for space rather than another planet,
  and generally went to various orbital stations and mining outposts."

"Nearly everything was meant for in-system though.
Foreign trade ships &mdash; from other star systems &mdash;
  they _did_ occasionally come through, but usually they were just junk traders."

"Junk traders?" Gallegos asked.

"Junk traders.
Basically, they deal in 'used' magic items.
They usually didn't like to admit that's what they're doing,
  but once you realize that mana depletion is local to within a few light-years of the location where a sigil is used,
  it makes a lot of sense.

"Depleted or burned-out magic items aren't of any use to most people,
  so junk traders buy them for cheap,
  and then all they have to do to make 'em work again is ship them off
  to a different star system where they resell them for a profit.

"Needless to say though, some of the stuff they try to pass off can be pretty sketchy,
  and usually we'd only deal with them through some kind of liason or broker that specialized in the junk trade.
Occasionally we'd get an order to ship containers they'd filled with magic gear to and from the surface,
  plus the usual supply shipments; food, water, oxygen."

--------

Angela collapsed onto the bed in the darkness of her room, absolutely exhausted and feeling like she needed to scream.
Everything was spiraling out of control, and there was just so much she needed to _do_.
Over the past week she'd spent upwards of 16 hours a day working &mdash;
  translating diagrams and pages of text from Carina's flight manuals,
  answering questions about kender biology and culture and technology,
  writing, learning, teaching.

She insisted, no demanded, to keep working, anything to help distract herself, to keep moving forward,
  but she only had so much stamina and could only work for so long.
Working felt like being in control, but the harder she worked, the less she felt like she _was_ in control.
That there _would_ be no end to it.
She nearly felt like throwing up.

She closed her eyes and focused on trying to calm down.

During the day she didn't often have trouble,
  at least while she was actively working on moving the project forward.
There were brief moments of down-time,
  but she was mostly able to cope and keep up appearances,
  and she even vaguely enjoyed her work most of the time.
Her most recent interview session with the CIA reminded her that
  once she got out of here she certainly would have a tale to tell,
  even if it wasn't as glamorous as some of the stories and legends she'd been told as a kid.

After a moment she was calm enough to sit up,
  and pulled out a large padlock from the side table drawer next to her,
  along with a set of lock picks from under her mattress.

Over the past few weeks she'd purchased a number of tools, bits of survival gear, the lockpicks she now held, other things,
  objects that in some sense represented freedom, being in control.
Part of it was just a sense of "being prepared", but more than that the possibilities that they represented,
  of taking her fate into her own hands, in some sense of "escaping" and leaving this all behind.

She sat for several minutes,
  focusing on manipulating the lock,
  carefully applying pressure to the tension wrench as she worked on excluding her worries from her mind.
Small careful movements, connected together, cascading into something larger.
The last pin set into place, the rotation of the plug.

It almost came as a surprise when the shackle finally popped open with a *snap*,
  and Angela quickly glanced around the room, vaguely startled.

While these objects &mdash; the climbing rope hidden under her couch, the box of MRE's stashed in one of the cupboards &mdash;
  while they did help her maintain a small semblance of control,
  having them here, even hidden, was still a small source of anxiety for her.

This apartment was _her_ own private space,
  but she couldn't quite shake off the worry that someone might walk in on her or find some of the items,
  and get the wrong idea.
That she'd have to face the embarrassment of having to try and explain it all.
She kept things hidden.

Angela stowed the lock and picks and stood up, walking to her table.
Still, it wasn't the same, and it didn't make her feel like she was losing control,
  not the way being followed everywhere in public, or working and living in the same place day after day, week after week.
In some ways this fear of being discovered itself that helped displace her other anxieties,
  but if nothing else it was something she could reason with, or at least about.

She slid out the case containing a set of metalworking hand tools &mdash; chisels, gouges, scorpers, files &mdash;
  and retrieved the partially-completed AR-15 lower receiver from the base of the potted plant where she'd hidden it.
It had taken her a while to muster the courage to purchase the 80% lower receiver she'd started from,
  but working on finishing it really did &mdash; at a risk of sounding corny &mdash;
  help give a sense of freedom and control over her fate.

Angela took off a shaving from inside the pocket with a graver, careful to make sure it didn't fall into the carpet.
At first she'd started off with a drill and drill jig to hog out most of the material,
  but the noise from the drill had had her on edge the entire time,
  looking over her shoulder and worrying someone might hear.

It wasn't really rational &mdash;
  nobody was going to intrude, and even if someone did, she had a legal right as a US citizen to do this &mdash;
  but the intense irrational sense of worry and embarrassment from the noise of using power tools had made her abandon them
  and switch to just using hand tools once she'd finished removing the bulk of the material.

This of course made it take longer, but building a functional firearm wasn't really the point:
  the point was managing her stress.
Definitely.

It was a curious thing, this fear of being "discovered".
On the one hand there was a worry of embarrassment from having someone get the "wrong idea",
  or inferring some sort of vaguely criminal "plan" that she'd have to explain away.

But there was more to it than that, and at some level there was a sense of defiance about the whole thing.
Maybe whatever "wrong idea" this hypothetical someone might get was really the _right_ idea,
  maybe she _should_ be "planning something".

Another shaving of metal fell into the trash.

Who were the hypothetical "someone"s that she felt the need to hide from, anyway?
Aside from protection from low-level criminals &mdash;
  of the sort she'd had a run-in with last April &mdash;
  there was the worry that, if they hadn't already,
  at some point they'd attract the attention of more organized adversaries.

Nobody really had a clear idea _who_ exactly that might be,
  but it made sense to try to hide from these supposed shadowy foreign actors as long as practical,
  assuming they existed.

But did they even exist?
Or was this just an excuse to let them surveil and maintain control of her themselves, under the guise of protection?

She stood up and peered through the front window blinds, switching off the front light to avoid silhouetting herself.

Her bodyguard sat in a black SUV, keeping watch from down below in the parking lot.
Down the street, the unmarked white utility van nobody she'd asked would admit they knew anything about sat in its usual spot.

So far, she hadn't been overtly prevented from doing as she pleased,
  aside from being refused entry to some of the classified or sensitive areas in Palmdale or at NIH.
At most, her bodyguard might ask her to wait for a moment to let them clear a room before she entered.

But she still didn't trust them;
  while in theory she could just walk out on the project and never come back,
  they were still on Lockheed's payroll,
  and she didn't know how far she'd be allowed to take it before they demanded she return,
  or how far they'd go to ensure she did.

There were a few ways she thought she might be able to get away,
  but she hadn't wanted to put the theory to the test,
  since if she did succeed it would likely make it even harder should she need to get away for real.

Angela returned to the table, and continued carving.

She didn't really trust the rest of Lockheed's staff, either, not really.

Maybe the research teams,
  in that they'd continue to act professionally and wouldn't intentionally harm her,
  but on a personal level?
You didn't become a high-level of academic without being driven,
  and if push came to shove,
  many of them would undoubtedly place their own research goals above hers.
She wouldn't blame them if they did,
  and for most of them it wouldn't even be intentional,
  but the fact remained.

Angela concentrated on the feel of the tool in her hand,
  trying to quash the feelings of paranoia.
All she had to do was grab her bag, climb down a rope from the rear window of the apartment,
  and she'd be off, away from all of this.

No.

Breath.

She needed to stay here.

Continue working with the humans.

Stay focused on her goal, of leaving the planet.

She couldn't afford to run away, however good it might feel to take control in the short term.

Plus, that's exactly what they'd expect,
  she'd need a better plan than that.
Whoever "they" were.

The moment passed, and Angela stroked the chisel against a diamond stone,
  resharpening it slightly.

Maybe Brenda could be trusted, in that way.
Angela definitely considered her a friend.
But, she'd gotten involved with Matt, and Angela wasn't sure how she felt about Matt.

Angela hadn't had a lot of interaction with the physics team recently,
  but Matt was still heavily involved with the research.
Nearly everything they were learning was brand new to everyone including her,
  and while some of the more experienced researchers did have backgrounds that helped them somewhat,
  at least from the outside it seemed like Matt was pretty much keeping pace.

It was also mostly Matt's fault she'd gotten stuck on this planet in the first place.
Angela had thought she'd gotten over this,
  but as stressed as she was she couldn't help but sill blame him, just a little.
Sure, Mike and Jess had been part of it too, but Matt had really been the one behind the initial sigils that led her here,
  and as much as she rationalized it and tried to let go, she couldn't help but hold that against him at some level.

Mike, on the other hand, had been involved in the seemingly arbitrary legal roadblock
  that had interfered with getting the original Auriga plans,
  and while they'd eventually been able to find a way around it,
  he was still in bed with the lawyers and bean counters.
As far as Angela knew, he was currently involved in dealing with the public backlash resulting from the airplane sigil failure.

Mike was trustworthy in that said what he meant and meant what he said,
  and likely was a big part of getting Lockheed to honor the deal they'd made with her,
  but Angela still didn't trust him on a personal level.

And there was Jess. Could she trust Jess?

Angela would be returning to Palmdale tomorrow morning, flying out of DCA.
At least change of scenery between Palmdale and DC would provide some measure of relief from the endless spiral she was trapped in,
  even if it itself was only part of a bigger endless spiral.
Airports were large and crowded, and with her small size it would be easy to get away and disappear.
She could fit everything she needed to escape in her carry-on bag,
  assuming she could get it past TSA, although that wouldn't be hard,
  and from there she'd have plenty of options to put distance between herself and &mdash;

By the time she stopped herself, she'd already put down the chisel and had started pulling out some of the necessary equipment.

No.

Stop.

She could handle this.

She forced herself to set everything down.
This was not what she needed to be doing.
Was it?

If having a plan, being prepared, if that helped her stay focused on her real goal, was that such a bad thing?
It wasn't as if she'd actually have to go through with it, right?

She knew she was rationalizing.

She knew she needed help.

**Crystal City Marriott Hotel**  
*Arlington, Virginia*

Solomon folded another pair of pants and placed them into his suitcase, packing for his flight back to Cairo.

He'd been "forced" to take a semi-unofficial leave as part of some political maneuvering 
  following the success of the American's Auriga 4 mission,
  which the political opponents of the Coral Sound project had tried to interpret as a "failure"
  of his project's mission in order to have it cancelled outright.
From day one of the new charter this had been an inevitability,
  as given the massive head-start the Americans had on them and their aggressive pace,
  only a fool would have expected they'd be able to genuinely get to Carina first.
On top of that, opponents of the project had managed to impede their efforts to coordinate
  with several other flight hardware vendors and launch partners,
  and while his team had managed to make some progress, things were still a long way from being ready.

Solomon had never been much of a politician except by necessity,
  relying on his superiors to handle the political maneuvering so he'd be free to coordinate actual operational details.
If he'd realized the full extent of the political squabbles he'd be stumbling into by accepting the new charter
  he might have simply refused it altogether,
  and tried to force a renewal of the un-amended charter.

But however much he disliked it, he'd seen this coming,
  and he'd been maneuvering to deal with this eventuality nearly from the start.
Taking this week-long "vacation" to the United States was in fact a political move,
  a way to flaunt his unofficial "leave" status to force his sponsors to grant the project
  the additional authority needed to overcome the current political interference.
The gordian logic behind this move made even his head hurt to consider,
  but it was now time for him to return to Cairo.

He'd also had another reason for this trip; specifically, for coming to Washington DC.

Over a year ago when he'd traveled to the US to procure what he'd initially believed was simply another hoax alien craft,
  there had been a second rumor circulating about the identity of the supposed occupant,
  an individual by the name of Angela Smith living in Elko, Nevada, in the same general area as the landing site.
Solomon had of course done his due diligence and looked into it,
  even going as far as calling their &mdash; her &mdash; employer,
  but the evidence for it had all been circumstantial at best,
  and he'd dismissed it as just another hoax.

Of course, at that point he hadn't even confirmed that the alien craft was genuine yet,
  much less examined the items inside it,
  and by the time he'd come to the conclusion that "Angela Smith" warranted a second look,
  that trail had already gone cold, and this Angela character had disappeared.
He'd still put feelers out in case she turned up somewhere,
  but that was about all he'd been able to do and he'd been forced to abandon the effort.

That had changed after the incident a little over two months ago.
Initially all he'd had to go on was the brief all-points bulletin that had been issued to police in the Washington DC area
  with a description for an individual resembling his target.
The bulletin itself was generic enough he wouldn't have spotted it,
  but the company's intelligence aggregation servers had somehow singled it out for him.
From there, he'd gradually managed to assemble a picture of what had happened,
  using Maltego to piece everything together,
  but investigating it remotely without boots on the ground was an uphill battle.
This was the real reason he'd come to Washington DC in particular.

Most recently, he'd managed to identify a handful of candidates for who the responding officer from the mugging might have been,
  and had painstakingly researched them to determine somewhere he could meet them in person and surreptitiously
  try to determine the answers to a few questions.
This most recent outing he'd finally gotten the right guy,
  and Solomon was now fairly certain Angela had been handed off to the United States Secret Service following the mugging incident.
Meaning, in conjunction with the US President Marshall Barrera's uncharacteristic appearance at a charity event that same night &mdash;
  and reported interaction at said event with a VP from the same company responsible for the Auriga program &mdash;
  that it was likely the US president or someone under his command
  that had coordinated the unusual response to the red line train fire.
  
What he couldn't figure out, was whether either or both of the incidents &mdash; the train fire, and the mugging &mdash;
  had been intentional assassination attempts by some third party.
Officially, the train fire had of course been ruled an accident,
  but the more he learned the more it seemed like this had in fact _been_ a genuine accident.

Among other things,
  of the 68 passengers that had been on board at the time if the fire there had been only a single fatality and eight serious injuries.
Assuming Angela was genuinely an extraterrestrial,
  it's possible this fire could have been some kind of chemical weapon she would be uniquely vulnerable to,
  but that would imply whoever had organized the hit had improbably extensive knowledge about their biology.
And whatever the theoretical chemical agent might've been,
  there hadn't been anything unexpected in his own analysis he'd had done
  on the soot sample he'd managed to get from the tunnel wall near the Bethesda station.
  
Either way, Angela had definitely gotten off the train before that.
In some ways this supported the theory there had been foul play,
  assuming she'd gotten off because she'd noticed signs of the pending hit.
But that argument would apply nearly as well if she'd simply noticed signs of a pending _genuine accident_,
  and making sure the target is _still on the train_ before deploying expensive xeno-specific chemical weapons
  wasn't the sort of detail that got overlooked when planning something like this.
  
The subsequent mugging likewise, taken on its own, really did seem like a genuine random untargeted crime.
Originally Solomon had though the supposed perpetrator, a Mr. John Chambless, 17, had just been a patsy,
  but the fact Angela had survived clearly meant it hadn't been a professional hit,
  and after his talk with the responding officer who'd shot the perpetrator, Solomon was now fairly sure
  that the young man in the casket at the funeral had most definitely been the same young man who'd assaulted Angela.
And he was definitely local &mdash; the family resemblance to the putative next-of-kin wasn't something you could just fake,
  and about half a year earlier he'd been involved in a domestic violence incident in the same area, as the victim, not the perpetrator.

Aside from those surrounding Angela herself, all the facts checked out;
  at _most_ the perpetrator might've been handed a $20 and told to watch out for someone matching Angela's description,
  but even that was a real stretch.
Given the distance from the station the organizers would have had to pay off
  at least a dozen other local thugs to cover other similarly remote routes Angela might have taken,
  and Solomon hadn't found any of the traces something like that would inevitably leave.

In either case though, Solomon was out of time.
He needed to be back in Cairo to be able to ensure the blame
  for failing to beat the American's Auriga program fall on the appropriate parties rather than him and his team,
  and ensure he'd be able to retain control of the program.

Solomon checked his flight reservations one more time.
He had another matter he needed to attend to in New York,
  and had booked a morning flight from DCA to JFK that would give him an 8-hour layover before the overnight flight to Cairo.

He still didn't have any idea _where_ Angela was,
  but Solomon was out of time.
