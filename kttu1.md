Kai Travels the Ultiverse, Question 1!

> By some miraculous twist of fate, I've found myself in your world.
> Somewhere random, chosen by you.
> What do I need to do to adapt quickly, so that I can survive?
> I'm a young 17 year old male with a broad spectrum of basic skills, so I can adapt relatively well.
> Maybe I'm out in the wilderness, so describe what I need to eat and what I should avoid.
> Maybe, I'm in a dictatorship city in your world, so I need to law low.
> Perhaps, I've found myself in a laboratory and have to survive a trial of experiments.
> Whatever the case is, I'm looking for how I'll mainly acquire Food, Water and Shelter. Get creative!

There's a sharp jerk as the capsule's parachutes deploy,
  and after several tense moments it hits the ground with a _thump_.
Out the window, you can see a large plain of coarse, rocky dirt,
  reminiscent of old photos showing what mars used to look like.

But not quite.
And as you step out of the capsule in your pressure suit,
  you're able to spot the occasional hardly lichens,
  and patches of biologically-active soil crust breaking up the bare regolith.
Overall, the surface is more brown than red.

Large, jagged mountains loom on the horizon to the north,
  against a clear blue sky that indicated the presence of oxygen.
You'd been able to tell that much, at least, or you wouldn't have landed.

You unlach the pod's hatch and step out.
The gravity is a bit lighter than you're used to, but not by much,
  but the and the air pressure is much lower.
Your oxygen level readings did indicate you technically could survive without your helmet,
  thanks to a much higher relative concentration, but you'd quickly become winded if you tried to exert yourself.

The initial soil analysis doesn't turn up anything overtly toxic &mdash;
  low arsenic, moderate levels of heavy metals like mercury,
  but no toxic organometallic compounds that would be likely to cause problems.
After over 20 hours in the bulky pressure suit you're wearing, you're able to crack it open and pull off your helmet,
  replacing it with a lightweight breathing mask that only provided supplimental oxygen.
  
You gather up the parachute cloth from where it fell around the pod, and stow it neatly inside.
Finally, sfter assembling the rover and transferring your supplies to it from the capsule,
  you set off south, heading very slightly downhill.
Away from the mountains, and toward what you believed might be a settlement that you'd spotted as you landed.

----

After a few hours driving across the rough terrain,
  you eventually come across a small narrow gully,
  about foot across but several feet deep.
Hardy looking tufts of dry grass poke up past the rim,
  but the narrow riverbed at the bottom is, for now, dry.

You follow the gully along its edge for miles,
  and it gradually expands into a ravine, dozens of feet deep but still only a few across.
Occasionally smaller gullies intersect with it to feed it,
  and while you're able to drive across the smaller of them,
  as they get bigger you're having to detour further and further to find a point where you can that you're able to cross.
  
Eventually, the ravine you're following joins into a massive canyon,
  easily a mile across.
You can just barely see sunlight reflecting off the bottom of the canyon,
  giving the barest hint that there may be flowing water at the bottom.

The photographs you took from orbit show this canyon stretching hundreds of miles in either direction,
  until it meets an even larger canyon to the west.
At least, you think that's where you are;
  here, there are no GPS satellites in orbit, or anything like them.
You'll have to wait for nightfall to make the stars visible if you want to determine it for sure.
On the other side of the canyon in the distance,
  the cluster of large squat domed buildings you'd seen on your way down peeked just barely above the horizon.

----

Nightfall comes, and with it comes rain.
This was what you had expected, but nothing had prepared you for the sheer violence of it.
Water from the plains surges around the rocky outcrop at the canyoun edge where you'd anchored your vehicle,
  crashing over the edges of the canyon.
Massive rapids span the entire width of the canyon floor,
  and the small ravine you'd been following formed a torrential waterfall where it emptied into the canyon.

Eventually, the rain stops, and the floods subside, leaving you to the silence of the night,
  broken only by the slow trickle of water and the sound of your breathing.
Overhead, the milky way shone, unpolluted by artificial lights.

----

Two hours before dawn,
  you awaken to the small dot of light of this sun's binary partner rising above the horizon to the east.
The light it gives is dimmer than a full moon,
  but harsher, all coming from a single point in the sky and casting sharp shadows.

The domed city in the distance shines white under the light of this distant second sun.
The edge of the canyon is noticeably closer than it was the night before.

At this point, you're forced to abandon your vehicle.
You can't drive it down the canyon walls.

You find a sturdy rock outcrop back from the edge, and secure it in place with metal anchors into the rock,
  covering it with a heavy UV-resistant tarp.
Most of the important items are loaded into a pack you can carry.
Hopefully your vehicle will still be there if and when you return.

As the day progresses and you approach the canyon floor,
  the sounds of the river below gradually fade,
  and by the time you reach it the water level is barely up to the edges of your boots.
The water is crystal clear,
  and you can see small flecks of iron and gold in the sediment underneath it.
The minerals in the sediment would be easy to pan for, if you had more time.

You taste the water, and spit it out.
This water is saturated with minerals and salt, and you must distill it if you wish to drink.
Again, if you had more time.

The most difficult part of crossing the cayon lay ahead,
  and if you were still in the canyon when the rains returned next nightfall,
  you would surely die.
You cross the stream and begin your ascent.

----

The rains hit just as you make it to the top,
  and you're forced to fight the shallow rushing water against your boots
  as you scramble to a rocky outcrop from which you can wait it out.
  
The rain pours down, as it did the previous night,
  and you use this opportunity to refill your water bottles: the rain itself at least is safe to drink.
The sounds of rushing water in the canyon below lull you to sleep.

----

The next day, you continue your trek,
  uphill away from the canyon and towards the structures in the distance.

Civilization becomes more evident as you encounter a packed dirt track,
  with occasional wheel ruts indicating vehicular use.
You have yet to encounter its users,
  but as you follow the track through the rough terrain toward the settlement the terrain changes.
Rocky flatlands give way to large, flat, cultivated fields, surrounded by dikes and channels meant to divert flood waters.

The unfamiliar plants in these fields are as alien to this planet as you,
  but a bit of investigation reveals the thick starchy tubers buried beneath the surface,
  for which they are grown. 
Whether they were edible for a human,
  especially uncooked, was something you would need to learn,
  but that could wait until you'd reached the settlement.
Perhaps this was already known to them;
  while uncommon in most corners of the galaxy, humans weren't unknown either.
Likely, the tubers would need to be ground into a pulp and the raw starch settled out,
  and the starch itself washed many times before being cooked, as with arrowroot on Earth.

A labor-intensive process,
  but if you were able to trade for enough of them,
  it would mean you wouldn' have to subsist on only the meager rations you'd been able to bring
  while attempting to cultivate and waiting on the first harvest from your own seeds.
And it meant that if the seeds _failed_ to grow,
  there was still the possibility you could survive.

But that all depends on the goodwill of the settlement ahead,
  finding a way to communicate, learning the language,
  and finding something they would be willing to trade for.

As you progress, the terrain changes.
In contrast to the lichen-covered wasteland from before,
  the spaces between the fields are now dominated by the hardy scrub grasses you'd seen earlier in the ravine,
  and even the occasional adventurous shrub clinging to the rocks from which it grew.

At some point the dirt track transitions to a paved concrete road.
The giant air-supported domes of the settlement loom ahead of you.
