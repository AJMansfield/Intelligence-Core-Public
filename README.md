This is a story about sentient AI in a very near-future setting, in particular about what it's like to be and AI, with much of the same technology as today.

This is the public repository for the series. Anything here is either already published to reddit or will be in the very near future.

I haven't yet figured out a way to do some kind of automatic continuous deployment, so for now I'm still manually posting things from here to reddit, but I hope to get that set up eventually&trade;.

If there are any grammatical errors or anything, feel free to submit a PR, and I'll update the reddit posts with any changes.
