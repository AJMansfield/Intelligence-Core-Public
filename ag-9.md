Brenda came to a stop and stepped off the treadmill,
  trailing electrode wires and hoses,
  and stood there with her hands on her knees,
  sweat pouring off her as she gasped for air through the CPET mask.

Part of the understanding the research team had come to with Angela is that they'd have a human undergo all of the same tests,
  and today was Brenda's turn to act as the human guinea pig.
In addition to acting as a control to ensure any inter-species comparisons were made under identical conditions,
  for the research team this also served as an 'ethical barometer' of sorts to ensure they didn't go to far.

Angela for her part had made it clear she was just as interested in studying them as they were her,
  and this also helped to make sure there was no miscommunication about exactly what would be done in a given test.
It would have been a gross understatement to call Angela's command of the English language "impressive",
  especially given the time frame she'd had to learn it,
  but there were still occasional miscommunications:
  since she picked up new technical vocabulary nearly instantly,
  it was all too easy to unconsciously use novel pieces of terminology and assume she understood it.
(She often would anyway, from structure and context, but it wasn't always 100%.)

In any case though, today they were measuring respiratory function, metabolism, and a few other related metrics.
And while yesterday had been easy &mdash;
  all she'd had to do was sit in a chair and breath through the hose &mdash;
  todays experiments involved _running_.

After a few minutes, once her heart had stopped pounding, she looked up at Angela and grinned.

--------------

As they waited for Brenda to finish recovering, one of the technicians started preparing Angela for the next run,
  peeling adhesive electrodes off of a sheet and carefully sticking them to various spots on her upper torso.
Beyond actual metabolic tests, they were also using this as an opportunity to try to adapt
  human electrocardiogram technology to work with phascolian physiology.
While merely making the equipment _work_ wouldn't magically also give them the
  reams of clinical data and decades of accumulated experience required to make the most effective use of an ECG plot,
  in the short term it could still be very effective at at least _detecting_ abnormalities,
  and Angela could see the enormous potential as a diagnostic tool in the future.
  
Initially this whole process had been fairly cumbersome,
  as none of the clothes she had that were suitable for athletic wear left any of the relevant areas exposed,
  and couldn't easily be modified without making them too revealing.
As she'd made clear,
  standing nude or nearly nude in front of an audience was _not_ something she was comfortable with _regardless_ of species.

So after some work &mdash; and with significant discussion regarding what she would consider modest &mdash;
  the team had managed to procure a pair of what were essentially high-riding bicycle shorts,
  black spandex garments extending from just above her knees to just below the base of her ribcage.
While some from her birth planet might have considered them inappropriately tight-fitting,
  it at least covered her abdomen well enough for modesty sake,
  while still leaving her chest, upper back, and shoulders bare,
  and this was what she wore now.

One of the other technicians signaled to Brenda that they were finished collecting spirometry data,
  and as she pulled off the mask another technician started carefully removing her electrodes.

"Last run for today, still up for it?"

Angela snorted. "Oh please, you were nearly at the point of falling over just a minute ago, you're one to talk."

The technician indicated for her to raise her left arm,
  and Angela obliged as he stuck another patch to the bottom of her arm and three more going down her side.

"Yo, Vince!" Brenda called to the technician standing in front of the readouts on the instrument cart. "What's my score?"

The man sighed. "First off, there's not just one 'score' I can give you, there's a lot of complicated fac&mdash;"

Angela broke him off. "Come on, this is the last one, I need a number to beat."

"If you can." Brenda coughed back under her breath as she pulled a t-shirt on over her sports bra.

"And secondly," Vince sounded mildly irritated, "_this is **not** a competition_."

There was a momentary awkward silence as the tech stickering Angela finished applying the last few adhesive patches around her neck
  and started clipping in the wires.

"Ok, fine." Vince tapped on the keyboard for a few moments.
"Brenda, you were messily devoured by a bear after ... six ...
  assuming a five second head-start, you'd have been eaten after 11.7 seconds."
  
Another tech handed Angela the CPET mask to measure her breathing, and she strapped it on.

"That's not a very ... comforting figure," Brenda responded, with mock concern,
  as Angela stepped onto the treadmill and prepared herself to begin sprinting.
  
In truth, it was a very apt comparison.
According to a TV nature documentary she'd watched on bear attacks,
  bears were apparently one of the few top land predators that could actually pose a serious risk to an unprepared human.
At the heart of it, it didn't _really_ matter how fast your time was on a fixed distance track,
  only who or what you could _outrun_.

----------

After finishing up with the tests, Brenda changed out of her exercise clothes and quickly showered,
  taking advantage of the opportunity to wash away the accumulated sweat and body odor.
There was a project status meeting with all of the team leads in half an hour,
  and while Brenda wasn't strictly required to be there,
  her cognitive science research had taken on a lot more importance after the subitization discovery,
  and she was _strongly encouraged_ to attend.

After she finished buttoning up her blouse and pulled her lab coat back on,
  she exited the changing room and knocked on the door to the other shower.

"Angela already headed off." The technician who'd spoken wheeled an equipment cart down the hall past her.

_Oh. Oh well._

This was one behavior that Brenda really didn't understand.
Whenever they finished up with a scheduled _anything_, Angela would often just _disappear_ afterward,
  and Brenda knew from experience that she'd be nowhere to be found in the intervening time
  until the next scheduled meeting or other event.
She wasn't ever late or anything &mdash;
  indeed, she always showed up on time &mdash;
  but the one or two times Brenda had asked about where she'd been (not in a confrontational way, just as smalltalk)
  she'd only responded with vague excuses about "getting lost".
Which, given this had become a fairly regular pattern, was certainly _odd_ if nothing else.
This wasn't a _problem_ exactly;
  Angelan was _allowed_ to be in this part of the facility, if she felt like wandering around that was fine.

But Brenda _would_ have appreciated the company for the fifteen-or-so minutes left until the meeting.

--------

As Brenda had expected, Angela was the last to arrive to the project status meeting,
  walking in at exactly the scheduled time.

Ian Marcantel, the Lockheed VP in charge of their side of the project was there,
  as well as two of the executives from Sigil-tek, the company Lockheed was partnered with for this project.
Brenda had been surprised to learn that Mike, their CEO, and Matt, their CTO, were nearly her age,
  and she'd been meaning to take the time to try to get to know them.
The team leads from each of the project teams were all present,
  and unusually, also two lawyers from Lockheed's legal department.

Once Angela had taken a seat, the Lockheed VP started going over the status of each facet of the project,
  calling on the team leads to report on their progress.
  
Flight team reported that the launch of the reconnaissance satellite had been a success.
In addition to just having better photographs &mdash; a few of which they showed on the projector &mdash;
  they were beginning to gather photogrammetry data to put together a full 3D model,
  although they cautioned that it'd probably be several more weeks before they had anything useable for engineering.
  
This was followed by a report from Brenda's own team lead;
  while most of the biomed team's progress was on [basic research] rather than specifically directed toward applied science goals,
  they had made significant progress towards determining several key metabolic details
  that would be required for designing life support and engineering appropriate meal plans for flight.


There was also another item:
Angela had earlier brought up trying to source a handful of phascolian-specific medications with the team,
  since she had apparently lost a large portion of her stores she'd brought with her,
  but still had a pharmacopeia that was easily sufficient to identify what she needed.
While a surprising number of the items in her pharmacopeia had been available from commercial suppliers,
  the vast majority were entirely unavailable,
  including two key reagents used for a number of diagnostic tests.
The biomed team had agreed it would be worthwhile to contract out to have those and a few other items synthesized custom,
  but as this was a rather significant expense they would need approval before proceeding &mdash; which they got.

Next up was psychology.
Although again most of their work was basic research &mdash; understanding cultural aspects and such &mdash;
  there were a surprising number of applied science goals for the psychology team,
  particularly regarding user interface design and operating procedures.
While Angela had had little trouble learning to use human-designed computer interfaces,
  there was also no reason to think that all of the same visual cues would work the same way or be equally effective;
  on top of that the thresholds for [task saturation and related issues][task saturation] were still unknown
  meaning they still had no idea how far they would need to deviate from the normal procedure design rules.
  

"Ok, then that brings us to linguistics, that'd be... you, Stanley."
The VP turned to Dr. McGinnis.
"What's your status?"

"I've made some headway on the grammar,
  but there are several unfamiliar terms I've run across in the physics text &mdash;
  I assume technical terminology &mdash; that we'll need help from Angela on."

Angela looked down at her tablet and pulled up her calendar.
"You have a two hour block scheduled for Tuesday, tomorrow mid-afternoon, will that be enough?"

Dr. McGinnis pulled up her own tablet.
"Well, I was planning to use that time to collect more speech samples to try and figure out &mdash;"

"You don't need to be able to speak it, those texts are idiographic anyway."

"Well, based on the samples we already have we think some of the terminology in a few of the texts may have been derived phonetically,
  using slight variations on a handful of glyphs to denote what we think are similar-sounding but unrelated words,
  actually I think a significant fraction of the lexicon likely developed this way
  and having more speech data should allow us to work out a lot more of the vocabulary by ourselves."

Angela paused for a moment, thinking.
"Actually yeah, I can see what you mean.
Let's see, right before I have some more medical stuff scheduled, is that flexible?"
Angela looked over at the biology team lead.

The VP interrupted, gently.
"Let's not get side-tracked, we'll come back to discussing the schedule once we're finished with status reports."
He paused for a moment, making a note on his pad and giving Dr. McGinnis an opportunity in case she had something else to report.

"If that's all ... physics team, I assume you're still waiting on translations?"
He turned to their team lead, near where Matt was sitting.

"We've been able to make a bit of progress,
  thanks to Matt's earlier work with Angela on the math notation and the bits we do have,
  we've got at least a general idea what's going on.
We've been having a lot of trouble on the experimental front though,
  while we've been able to copy and experiment with the working sigils we already had,
  we've had no luck actually creating anything from scratch,
  even just directly following the examples and diagrams in the text.
Matt and Dr. Canales both seem to think we're missing something entirely, <!-- Wilma R. Canales -->
  but none of us really have any idea what;
  I'm more of the opinion we just need to get more translated but
  hopefully we'll be able to put a few questions to Angela later and figure out what's going on."

Matt nodded in agreement, and the meeting shifted back to the VP.

"Noted."
The VP made another note on his pad.
"We'll see if we can fit an interview into the schedule once we get to that.
Any objections?"
He paused for a moment.
"Alright, engineering?"

"We're still mostly waiting until we know what we're trying to build.
Our earlier interview with Angela regarding what she remembers of the operating procedures
  did shed _some_ light on what we're working with,
  but aside from work on the flight suit and acceleration couch we're pretty much dead in the water,
  until either the flight team or the recovery team manage to turn up something we can use.
I've heard some things that the recovery team might've made some progress
  but I'll wait for them to report before commenting on that."

"Alright, unless the recovery team has something,
  we'll hold off on assigning additional engineers to your team until you're able to use them."
The VP turned to the recovery team, where Mike and the two lawyers were sitting.

"Actually, we've run into a rather significant legal roadblock trying to recover the pod."
Mike began.
"We were able to confirm thanks to Angela that a video we found uploaded last Wednesday
  to the 'Toomey Tales' YouTube conspiracy channel does indeed show the actual pod."
He put up a screenshot from the video on the projector, showing what was unmistakably some kind of atmospheric reentry pod.
"We were able to use details from the video footage to track down the location."
He put up a satellite map on the projector with a placemark indicating one of the buildings.
"We know it's _here_, in _this building_."
He put up a google street view image showing the front of the building.

"Ok, so what's the issue?" Angela asked as he paused.

"Well the short version, is because of some legal stuff, getting to the dude who has it isn't simple.
The long version, well, you'd better explain Rob." <!-- Robert K. Ransdell, Esq.-->
He gestured to one of the lawyers sitting next to him.

"Sure." Rob pulled out a pad with some notes on it.
"The problem is that the pod is currently in possession of this man &mdash; Solomon Riviera."
he pulled out a file, flipped it open to a photograph, and slid it across the table.
"Worked as a fairly high-ranking bureaucrat in Africa,
  bouncing between different sovereign corporations for a few years before settling down with NARECO.
Based on public records, or rather the conspicuous lack of certain records,
  we think he was probably involved in the intelligence community as some sort of spymaster or something,
  before suddenly retiring from service about 10 years ago to chase aliens, which he's been doing ever since.
  
"Unfortunately for us, and because of the particular bureaucratic details of his retirement,
  he's still considered an African Union official in the legal sense,
  meaning that there are a number of anti-corruption laws that restrict our ability to legally make contact with him
  except in the context of "official duties" as defined in the Omnibus Anti-Corruption Treaty of 2031.

Most of the restrictions don't really apply to private individuals, but our
  &mdash; by which I mean Lockheed-Martin's &mdash;
  status as a US government contractor means we're going to need to tread quite carefully here."

--------

The next morning, Solomon met up with his team at their office.
His reactivation papers and operating license documents had finally arrived last night,
  and he posted them on the wall alongside the labor laws posters in the break room,
  but beyond the basics of personnel and project management he really wasn't sure what to expect.

After the end of the briefing last night, they'd spent several hours discussing approaches to reverse-engineering the vessel,
  but with no clear conclusion.
Ideally they'd have preferred if they could get access to some kind of penetration scanner to examine it before they did anything else,
  but gaining access to a scanner large enough for the entire vessel was prohibitively expensive given their limited budget.
  
Joyce had tossed around the idea of trying to monetize the project by publishing an online documentary series about the project,
  and while there weren't any compelling reason _not_ to do this &mdash;
  it would, after all, be a good way to ensure any collected information was published &mdash;
  Solomon doubted that this would be able to bring in enough revenue to matter.

For now though, they would have to make do with manual exploration.
  Any loose articles inside the vessel could be removed and catalogued,
  flakes of rust and paint flakes could be sent for analysis,
  and they'd just have to take care to avoid disturbing or contaminating the vessel as much as possible.
Hopefully by the time they got to needing to disassemble anything,
  they'd have a better idea of how to proceed further.

--------

Once Solomon and the team had suited up and finally opened the vessel, it turned out they needn't have worried about contamination.

Aside from rust and other natural decay,
  there were clear signs of vandalism on the vessel's interior, including a significant amount of obviously-human-made debris.
It appeared a previous owner had used the pod for more than just showing off.

Five empty bottles of Bud Lite, fragments of a sixth,
  an empty bag of Doritos,
  a handful of clear cellophane food wrappers,
  several cigarette butts,
  and part of a marijuana joint were all carefully documented and placed into individual bags per protocol.
A partially-consumed pack of 5 gum with three pieces left came next, followed by two gum wrappers,
  and it appeared the former contents of one of those wrappers was here to stay,
  stuck to the glass face of one of the pod's instruments.
They'd tried pulling peeling the gum off, but it hadn't budged,
  and they didn't want to risk scratching the dial or using solvents,
  so they were forced to leave it for now.

It wasn't until the following day when they got to the first actual alien artifact:
  some kind of padded jumpsuit.
Joyce had Jack take several pictures of the object in place before they dared touch it,
  since at that point they hadn't even been sure what it was yet.
They'd carefully pulled it out and laid it on a sterile table, videotaping the entire process,
  and took more high-resolution photographs.
An alien helmet came next.

Solomon was initially surprised at how human-shaped the jumpsuit was.
Although clearly sized for a being much smaller than himself,
  the proportions were remarkably similar,
  with two arms and two legs.
The gloves they pulled out next even had four fingers and a thumb on each hand.

This matched up alarmingly well with the rumored description of a so-called "alien"
  that had started circulating online at about the same time as the pod.
Solomon had, as a matter of course, investigated the matter,
  even going as far as making a phone call with the supposed alien's supposed employer in Elko,
  but the evidence simply hadn't been compelling enough to warrant further investigation.
At the time he had dismissed it as just a rumor, but now he was no longer convinced that he had been correct.

They found several other items of interest underneath the suit as well:
More food wrappers, this time bearing alien markings rather than human ones, made of cellophane or something remarkably similar to it.
A used chemical test card, measuring 104mm by 74mm (about the size of two credit cards next to each other),
  and bearing more alien markings, including some that appeared to be penciled on.
An alien pencil, consisting of a graphite lead surrounded by an unrecognised fibrous material, and coated in white paint.

It wasn't until Sunday morning when they tried opening the vessel's storage cupboards that they found the real treasure trove.

"Ok, cupboard number six is empt &mdash; actually wait, there's some, are these ... books?"
Mideple called out after pulling it open.

The first one was essentially a spiral-bound notebook,
  with off-white pages measuring 117mm across and 165mm along the binding (about a quarter of a sheet of printer paper),
  covers consisting of a thick manila-colored cardstock bearing typewritten alien text,
  and another alien pencil similar to the one found earlier stuck through the spiral.
None of them understood any of the text, of course,
  but it was clear that most of the notebook's pages contained lists of some kind,
  and several pages also contained empty boxes in the middle of the text acting as blanks, some of which had been written in.

The next two books were a similar size to the first, but were paperback bound rather than spiral bound.
The thinner of the two was 13mm thick and appeared to be a flight manual &mdash;
  they were able to recognise diagrams of the various control panels in the craft,
  as well as diagrams showing the locations of fasteners on various access panels.
One of the last illustrations clearly depicted the steps for rolling up and packing the pod's parachute.

The thicker book, about 30mm thick, appeared to be a navigation manual, at least the parts they could figure out.
While there were only a handful of illustrations, the ones there were showed orbital diagrams,
  atmospheric entry trajectories, and, near the end,
  what looked like plots of the emission spectra of several common chemicals,
  and phase diagrams for water, ammonia, and a few other substances they didn't recognise.

The last book, though, was much larger than the other three,
  measuring 661mm across by 467mm along the binding (four times as large as a sheet of printer paper),
  and was printed on extremely thin pages that contained what appeared to be _complete mechanical drawings of the pod_.

Solomon himself hadn't been directly involved in recovering most of these items,
  and had fallen back to his old project management role, 
  but these findings were incredibly exciting, and _far_ more than he had initially hoped.
