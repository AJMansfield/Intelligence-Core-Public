*Bethesda, Maryland*

Brenda sat idling outside the Metro stop waiting for Angela to arrive.
It was odd that she insisted on taking the train,
  but there were a lot of odd things about her.
At least this specific quirk made sense:
  autonomy was clearly very important to her.

That specific fact had taken the business side a while to come to terms with;
  to them she was an extraordinarily valuable asset worth going to extra lengths to protect.
But she consistently refused measures that would impinge on her autonomy,
  be it using the company's own private planes,
  having a chauffeur drive her to and from the airport,
  or having any kind of personal security accompany her.

She _had_ at least agreed to update them periodically so they'd know when to expect her;
  she was usually _very_ punctual,
  and the few times she'd been unable to she'd always communicated that fact well in advance.

But supposedly Angela had gotten on the last train 25 minutes ago,
  meaning she already should've been here, or at minimum sent a message.

Brenda looked around and refreshed on her phone.
Still no message, and no Angela.

This _really_ wasn't like her.

It was at this point that the first fire truck pulled up to the curb, sirens blaring.

Solomon had messaged the rest of the team the moment he'd finished with Mr. Usama,
  and by the time he arrived back at the warehouse his team was waiting for him in the meeting room.

"Ok. Starting with the good news.
The charter's been extended for two years, and we _did_ get a budget increase."
That was an understatement if ever there was one.

"But. There have been some changes.

"The project focus has changed."

"This is about ... _Angela_," the president said,
  almost whispering as he leaned toward Ian.

Ian was speechless as he followed the president into one of the empty side-rooms.
What did he want, and how much did he know?
Why was he showing his hand now?

At that moment his phone alerted him to a notification.
_Whatever it was had better be important_ he grumbled to himself.
Then he read it.

"I'm sorry, something's just come up I have to deal with."
He honestly wasn't trying to make excuses, but this needed his attention _immediately_.

Ian made to leave, but one of the president's guards stepped to block the door.

"You're not getting off that easily," the president growled.
"You're going to tell me _exactly_ what this "Angela" is, and what you are doing with it."

"First off, "it" is a "she", and _she_'s missing."

"Ok, so the higher-ups are convinced that what we have is an early prototype of this American "Auriga" capsule?"
Joyce asked as Solomon finished.

"Yes, that's correct.
They're still interested in it in its own right,
  but as far as I know they're unaware that the capsule we have is genuinely alien in origin.

"What they _are_ interested in is the _other_ piece of the puzzle,
  2059 QP8432, dubbed "Carina" by the Americans.
They are aware that _that_ object _is_ extrasolar in origin,
  and believe the Americans are developing their Auriga capsule to be able to dock with it,
  to get their hands on whatever advanced technology it contains.

"Our job, is to get there first.
By whatever means necessary."

**Presidential Limousine**  
*Washington DC*

"As I understand it, Angela had originally intended to settle here permanently,"
  Ian explained as the car drove,
  "but for whatever reason she now can't, and wishes to leave this planet."

It hadn't taken Marshall much prodding to get Ian to cooperate and tell him everything.
It had been a dirty move on his part to leverage the current situation
  by subtly implying he might have had something to do with her disappearance,
  but hopefully he'd be forgiven once this all played out.
  
"I guess it's not surprising that I don't understand her reasons;
  but from her explanation it seems to be some sort of cultural thing,
  not an issue with us or the environment or anything else."
Ian continued on, clearly quite stressed.
"But either way, it's not like we'd been "keeping" her anywhere,
  she's working with us of her own free will and been more than willing to cooperate.
Especially for biomed research everything we've done has been with her consent, and
  we've been mandating _very_ high ethical standards for all of our resea&mdash"

"So, in essence," Marshall interrupted him, "you've made a deal with her: help her off the planet in exchange for alien technology."

The car was silent for a few moments.

"It's a bit of an oversimplification, but ... basically yes."

"Well, seems reasonable enough.
I trust that the specifics of the deal were the best you could've gotten given the circumstances.

"And I appreciate that you've kept things under wraps rather than gone public with it.

"But as for the decisions about personal security that led to the present situation,
  while I understand the reasoning I _do not_ agree with it and am very disappointed.
From the sound of things it seems like she's really the one who needs to be lectured more than you" &mdash;
  Lord knows Marshall had recieved a lecture on this topic more than once from his own staff &mdash;
  "but whatever her status before arriving here,
  like it or not on _this_ planet she is a _very_ important person,
  and one that _will_ attract enemies once word starts to leak out.
That's assuming it hasn't already, and that the _current_ situation _was_ purely accidental.

"But either way, it is _not_ appropriate for her to have been exposed like this, period."

There was another silence, as Ian processed this.

The car drove along, before finally Ian broke the silence with a question.

"If you don't mind my asking, what do you intend to do?"

Marshall paused for a moment before responding, carefully.

"There's entire reams of paperwork and enough red tape to stretch from here to wherever she's from.
If and when the existence of extraterrestrials becomes public knowledge.
Hopefully not something I will have to deal with during my term."

He grimaced.

"But as far as _I'm_ concerned &mdash; 
  actually given what you've told me about her citizenship status,
  things are a lot simpler than they could've been &mdash;
  as far as I'm concerned Angela is the same as any other American.
Albeit one with particular strategic importance.

"So, to answer your question about what I intend to do?
Right now, I'm going to find her and make sure she's safe."

**White House Ops Room**  
*Washington DC*

"Colonel Krieger, what's the situation?"
The president walked into the command center,
  Ian trailing behind him.

"Sir! There was an incident on the red line thirty-one minutes ago between Tenleytown and Friendship Heights.
Tunnel heat sensors indicate a fire,
  corroborated by social media indicating that the tunnel and at least three of the train cars are filled with smoke.
Cause still unkown.
Local first responders have just started pulling passengers out of the tunnel.
Several victims are being treated for smoke inhalation,
  although most appear to have only minor injuries.
Odds are Angela is still on board,
  but it's possible she's among those already rescued;
  we currently have one man on-site working to identify if this is the case.

"We're currently working with WMATA to identify which train car she was on from their security recordings.
We've also issued an APB to local law enforcement on the possibility she may have gotten off before this incident."

The president turned.
"Ian! You have staff familiar with Angela's medical needs."
This wasn't a question.
"I need your staff to coordinate with Colonel Krieger,
  we need to make sure we can get her proper emergency treatment.
Should that prove necessary."
