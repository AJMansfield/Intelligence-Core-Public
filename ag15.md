Brenda sat idling outside the Metro stop waiting for Angela to arrive.
It was odd that she insisted on taking the train,
  but there were a lot of odd things about her.
At least this specific quirk made sense:
  autonomy was clearly very important to her.

That specific fact had taken the business side a while to come to terms with;
  to them she was an extraordinarily valuable asset worth going to extra lengths to protect.
But she consistently refused measures that would impinge on her autonomy,
  be it using the company's own private planes,
  having a chauffeur drive her to and from the airport,
  or having any kind of personal security accompany her.

She _had_ at least agreed to update them periodically so they'd know when to expect her;
  she was usually _very_ punctual,
  and the few times she'd been unable to she'd always communicated that fact well in advance.

But supposedly Angela had gotten on the last train 25 minutes ago,
  meaning she already should've been here, or at minimum sent a message.

Brenda looked around and refreshed on her phone one last time, but still no message, and no Angela.

Solomon had messaged the rest of the team the moment he'd finished with Mr. Usama,
  and by the time he arrived back at the warehouse his team was waiting for him in the meeting room.

"Ok. Starting with the good news.
The charter's been extended for two years, and we _did_ get a budget increase.
But there's been some changes.

"The project focus has changed."

"This is about ... _Angela_," the president said,
  almost whispering as he leaned toward Ian.

Ian was speechless as he followed the president into one of the empty side-rooms.
What did he want, and how much did he know?
Why was he showing his hand now?

At that moment his phone alerted him to a notification.
_Whatever it was had better be important_ he grumbled to himself.
Then he read it.

"I'm sorry, something's just come up I have to deal with."
He honestly wasn't trying to make excuses, but this needed his attention _immediately_.

Ian made to leave, but one of the president's guards stepped to block the door.

"You're not getting off that easily," the president growled.
"You're going to tell me _exactly_ what this "Angela" is, and what you are doing with it."

"First off, "it" is a "she", and _she_'s missing."

"Ok, so the higher-ups are convinced that what we have is an early prototype of this American "Auriga" capsule?"
Joyce asked as Solomon finished.

"Yes, that's correct.
They're still interested in it in its own right,
  but as far as I know they're unaware that the capsule we have is genuinely alien in origin.

"What they _are_ interested in is the _other_ piece of the puzzle,
  2059 QP8432, dubbed "Carina" by the Americans.
They _are_ aware that _that_ object _is_ extrasolar in origin,
  and believe the Americans are developing their Auriga capsule to be able to dock with it,
  to get their hands on whatever advanced technology it contains.

"Our job, is to get there first.
By whatever means necessary."

**Presidential Limousine**  
*Washington DC*

"As I understand it, Angela had originally intended to settle here permanently,
  but for whatever reason she now can't and wishes to leave this planet.
I guess it's not surprising that I don't understand her reasons;
  but from her explanation it seems to be some sort of cultural thing,
  not an issue with us or the environment or anything else,"
  Ian explained as they drove.

It hadn't taken Marshall much prodding after that to get Ian to cooperate and tell him everything.
It had been a dirty move on his part to leverage the current situation
  by subtly implying he might have had something to do with her disappearance,
  but hopefully he'd be forgiven once this all played out.

Ian continued on, clearly quite stressed.
"But either way, it's not like we'd been "keeping" her anywhere,
  she's been more than willing to work with us and
  we've been requiring very high ethical standards in all our reseach efforts that involve her."

"So, in essence," Marshall interrupted him, "you've made a deal with her: help her off the planet in exchange for alien technology."

The car was silent for a few moments.

"It's a bit of an oversimplification, but ... basically yes."

"Well, seems reasonable enough.
I appreciate why you'd be keeping things under wraps instead of going public with it."

There was another silence, broken after a few moments as Ian asked him a question.

"If you don't mind my asking, what do you intend to do?"

"There's entire reams of paperwork and enough red tape to stretch from here to wherever she's from,
  if and when the existence of extra-terrestrials becomes public knowledge.
Hopefully something for my successor to deal with." The president grimaced.

"As far as _I'm_ concerned, she's the same as any other American,
  albeit one with particular strategic importance.

"So, to answer your question about what I intend to do?
Right now, I'm going to find her and make sure she's safe."

**White House Ops Room**  
*Washington DC*

"Colonel Krieger, what's the situation?" the president called as he walked into the command center,
  Ian trailing behind him.

"Sir! There was an incident on the red line thirty minutes ago between Tenleytown and Friendship Heights,
  from reports one of the train cars caught fire and filled the tunnel with smoke.
Local first responders are on the scene and just now they've started pulling passengers out of the tunnel.
Several of them are being treated for smoke inhalation,
  right now we're not sure if Angela's among those already rescued or if she's still on board.

"We've issued a BOLO to local law enforcement on the off chance she got off somewhere else.
From what we know about her that doesn't seem likely but we're covering all our bases."
We're still working to figure out which train car she was on;
  I have several staff reviewing the WMATA's security tapes, but we need someone who can ID her."

The president turned.
"Ian! You have staff familiar with Angela's medical needs."
This wasn't a question.
"I need your staff to coordinate with Colonel Krieger,
  we need to make sure we can get her proper emergency treatment if that proves necessary.
Then work with them to ID her from the footage."

And with that the president walked out, leaving Ian there to be sucked into the operation.
