You sit on your bedroll against the concrete wall of the apartment,
  examining the plastic chips Leon had paid you with.

Each coin bears a colorful geometric design similar to the one on the badge you recieved when you first entered the city,
  and in addition to the fourteen intacts discs of varying sizes,
  there are also five wedges cut from other coins,
  like old-timey pieces of eight.

What these coins represent, exactly, is likely to remain a mystery for some time yet,
  but they definitely do work as currency,
  and you'd been able to exchange one of the wedges for a delicious fried something-or-other you couldn't identify,
  purchased from one of the food stands you'd passed on your way back here.

These plastic coins are rather light in your large hands though,
  and you're not really sure of their value.
Probably the larger more-intricately-decorated ones are worth more, but even if so, how much more?

Probably first on your list is getting your own place.
Sleeping on Morgan and Jerry's metaphorical couch (read: floor) is certainly better than sleeping in the street,
  but even if you'd had it all to yourself this tiny single room apartment would've been cramped.
You can't really even stand up to your full height, and you've already hit your head on the doorframe several times.

At that moment, Morgan opens the door and walks in buck naked from the communal showers across the hall,
  toweling herself off and dripping everywhere as she walks over to the bag where she keeps her clothes and belongings.

Very little about their physiology is at all attractive to you,
  and given she's a completely different species there shouldn't be anything improper about it,
  but it still makes you feel uncomfortable.
Given that this was a daily occurrence though, you'd just gotten used to it and did your best to ignore her.

Jerry for his part doesn't even seem to care when he's around for it,
  but he also isn't in the habit of walking across a public hallway buck naked,
  and usually makes at least an effort at modesty.

Dammit, you really need more space, and some privacy would certainly be nice, too.

But what can you even afford, on your wage?
And for that matter, who did you go through to get a place?
Did the city government own all these apartments?
Would you need to find an individual landlord to rent from?

As you consider this, sitting against the wall of the tiny room,
  Morgan finishes dressing and comes over next to you.

"Is ... is there a problem?" she asks, abruptly, instantly putting you on the defensive before you realize your mistake.

You sigh.
This was meant as an actual question, not some kind of passive-aggressive remark.
Both she and Jerry have managed to become quite proficient with English in the week since you first met them,
  but this sort of thing still happened frequently.
Honestly it would be weirder if it didn't, but still.

"Just, not sure how to proceed.
I know I need to get a bigger place &mdash;"
  you gesticulate, indicating the small size of the apartment "&mdash;
  but I don't really know anything about how things work in this city.

"I don't even know what the different coins are worth,
  and even if I found the right person to ask about my own place,
  how do I know they won't be taking advantage of me and overcharging me?"
You sigh again and let the fistful of plastic chips spill onto the floor in front of you.

"I guess, the other big problem,
  is how to get the rest of my stuff across the canyon from where I had to leave it.
I've got a bunch of stuff I had to abandon when I crossed over the canyon to the east,
  and while I think I managed to hide it well enough that it's still there,
  I don't have any way of getting it from where I left it.

"And while I've got some ideas for how to physically get it across,
  I don't have any of the tools or equipment I'd need to do it,
  and even if I did,
  someone could easily show up and steal it all while I'm in the middle of moving it,
  and even if they don't they could still just rob me on my way back to town."

As you vent, she sits down on the floor and counts through the coins.
"That's not very much," she admits after a moment.
"But maybe? I know a bigger place, maybe I can make a deal for not very much.
  And you can sell your things if you need. I can help, get good deal."

"Yeah." You sigh again. "I suppose I'll have to sell some my stuff, sooner or later."

You didn't notice when Jerry had entered, but he speaks up now.
"What is your other stuff across the canyon? Maybe we can help."

----

True to her word, Morgan manages to find you a bigger place,
  one with ceilings high enough you didn't have to constantly worry about hitting your head,
  and, thank god, 
  with its own shower and bathroom instead of the single communal bathroom shared between a dozen apartments in the old place.
There's even a table and chairs,
  and a small balcony.

There was, though, apparently some mismatch in expectations,
  as you're now sharing this new larger place with not just Morgan and Jerry,
  but also the two other migrant-class workers from the crew,
  Nydia and Eli (or so you've nicknamed them, anyway).

You guess it makes sense.
By splitting the rent five ways you _are_ able to get more square footage per dollar,
  or whatever units these halflings used anyway.
Given how much of a mess language is here, you're not sure if you want to open that can of worms.

In any case, over the next week &mdash; here, six days, the 78 day year being divided into thirteen of them &mdash;
  Jerry helps you locate most of the equipment you need in order to stretch a line across the canyon to use for moving your stuff across.

The basic concept is to stretch a thick steel cable across the canyon somewhere and anchor it firmly between two supports,
  then use a thinner cable to pull some sort of carriage across with the cargo suspended from it.
You've run the numbers,
  and three-quarter inch steel cable should be able to support the weight of the rover's main chassis.
The wheels and cargo would have to be hauled over separately, but that should let you maintain a reasonable safety margin,
  but it _should_ work.

Hopefully, you'll be able to purchase an end-of-reel offcut from one of the massive spools of
  steel cable used by the dome maintenance crews for construction and repairs.

Your initial design called for using wood beams to construct the A-frame braces and anchors at each end,
  but you quickly realize that there's not much in the way of "wood" available out here except as a luxury material.
However with Jerry's help, you're able to find some light-gauge steel box section that's suitable.

Either way, you still have no idea where to get the rigging hardware you'll need to put it all together though,
  and all of this is _quite_ expensive, more than you can afford at the moment.
Knowing how much all of this costs at least gives you a goal to save for though,
  and that's something.

One particularily good stroke of luck, though,
  is when Nydia manages to get a hold of a collection of survey maps that show parts of the canyon networks near the city.
You hadn't actually asked her to help,
  but this is a major breakthrough, and you're glad for it.

Up untill this point you've just had to take it on faith
  that you'd be able to find a spot narrow enough to cross,
  but using the map, you're able to identify a site only a couple days hike from the city
  where the canyon gets pinched between two large rocky outcrops and narrows to less than 150 feet.

(Apparently the map's creators had had similar thoughts to your own when they'd found the site,
  as it was marked as ideal spot for a hypothetical future bridge,
  not that such a bridge was likely to be built anywhere in the near future.)
  
So at least now you have a solid idea of exactly _where_
  you'll need to lug the 300 pound spool of &mdash; hey wait, isn't gravity lower here than on Earth?
You go back to your original calculations and run the numbers again.

Looks like half-inch steel cable will actually be enough,
  but even accounting for the slightly reduced gravity the spool of cable is still going to weight at least 80 pounds,
  and that's not counting any of the other equipment you'll need.
And it all has to be transported to the canyon's edge one way or another,
  and how you're going to manage that is still an unsolved problem.

The other big problem was operational.
Normally, for something like this you'd have at least two people,
  one on each side, to handle setting up and tensioning the cable,
  and of course for running things across.
Without a second person, you were going to need to hike across the canyon floor several times in order to set it up,
  and crossing won't be possible directly at the chosen site.
Rather, you'll have to hike nearly a day further south,
  almost to where you left the rover, in order to get across.

You quickly work out how many times you'll need to go across.
You'll have the rover on the far side at least, until you disassemble it to move across, so that saves at least a bit of time...

You add up the travel time. Six crossings, 23 days.
And that's assuming everything goes smoothly,
  and none of the equipment you'll be forced to leave unattended at the canyon edge is stolen or damaged.
Oh and don't forget that it rains every day,
  you'll need to find a way to prevent the cable from rusting,
  and there's still a good chance you'll manage to injure yourself in the process
  and probably get trapped at the bottom of the canyon and washed away and killed.

At some point you find yourself talking over the problems with your roommates.
Maybe one of them might have a better idea,
  or if nothing else you might be able to get one of them to loan you some cash to help pay for the equipment.

Probably not, but the answer's always no if you don't ask, right?

"Ok, well then, you can teach us how to set it up," Eli states, matter-of-factly.
"That way you don't have to travel back and forth for every step."

"Wait, what?"
It takes you a moment to process her statement.

Before you can respond, Jerry breaks in.
"I know a guy who works on the city domes,
  I can probably borrow a spool of cable for way cheaper than that as long as we return it when we're done."

"Woah woah woah, hold up a moment.
I mean, sure, I'd appreciate the help" &mdash; honestly, you really would &mdash;
  "but you've done more than enough to help already."

"I ... I don't understand what you mean."
Eli wore an expression you'd learned to interpret as puzzlement,
  shared to various degrees by the other three.
"We're ... we're all here, so we help."

You sigh.
There is clearly something being lost in translation here,
  but whatever the precise cultural meaning behind this,
  it's undeniable that they're serious about helping you.
And you really do need the help.

----

After some more work,
  you're able to find an unused area of land not too far from the city
  in which to practice setting up the line,
  and start working out a plan for how to train the four &mdash;
  now _five_ halflings, actually &mdash;
  how to safely rig the cable and pulleys.

About that.

The newest addition to the party you've nicknamed "Coke",
  partially because the one syllable you've managed to catch of her real name sounds a bit like "cola",
  and partially because you couldn't be arsed to care when making it up.
She just appeared one day, and was now apparently part of the team.
In any case, the name stuck, and it wasn't like any of them knew the difference.

One of the others &mdash; you think Jerry &mdash; had gone ahead and just _gotten_ a large spool of cable,
  however the cable he'd gotten was far too thin to bear the required load.
He corrected the issue the next day after you explained it to him,
  coming back with an even _larger_ spool of cable.

These sorts of developments just seem to _happen_ now, apparently.

Initially you try to resist, but your efforts are at best met with confusion,
  and although you're still not great at reading their expressions,
  you think you might have accidently hurt Morgan's feelings at one point by trying.
You're not even sure who's paying for it all at this point &mdash;
  Morgan has taken to holding on to your paycheck and has assumed some kind of "treasurer" role for the group,
  but last you checked all of this equipment was _far_ outside your price range,
  and you suspect that they're even paying for it out of their own pockets.

Not that you're complaning, but this seems like the sort of thing that might come back to bite you later,
  and it's about all you can do at this point to just take it in stride.

Just chill. Go with the flow. It seemed headed your way anyway.

Fortunately, it doesn't take too much practice with the equipment you've gathered
  before they're able to set up the A-frames and string the cable themselves.

And, more importantly, before you're confident enough to trust they'll be able to do it _correctly_.

All five of them are, of course, coming with you on the "adventure".
It's not even worth trying to dissuade them.

Hopefully you'll be able to leave before any more randomly decide to materialize.

----

At last the rest of your arrangements are in place and you're able to leave with your party of halflings.

Seven of them, to be precise.
Morgan, Jerry, Nydia, Eli, Coke, and two others you haven't given nicknames to yet,
  as you realize now that the others had taken the nicknames you'd given them as a sign of your approval.
For now, until you come to terms with and decide to accept your fate,
  you do your best to mumble through the alien pronounciations,
  and hope they don't decide to take _that_ as a nickname.

Almost all of them have their own weapons and travel gear,
  assorted pistols and bolt-action rifles, some with optics attached,
  but Nydia in particular has managed to produre &mdash; or perhaps already had &mdash;
  her own APC and cameoflage jumpsuit similar to the ones worn by the city guard,
  as well as an impressive-looking machine gun.

And are those ... yes, those are definitely grenades you just saw her stuff into her bag.

The cable and most of the equipment is carried in a small hand-cart that's traded between them periodically,
  and you are able to make good time on the dirt roads extending away from the city.


By dusk, you reach the point to turn off from the road,
  and strike camp just in time to avoid the rains.

Another day dawns.
Maneuvering the cart off-road over the rough terrain is slow going,
  but midday finds you at the canyon rim.
This is the point at which you split up.

From here, Jerry and Eli will proceed south with the cart to the site you'd chosen,
  and set up camp to await your arrival on the other side.
  
You, Morgan, Nydia, and Coke will travel north to the point where you'd crossed before.
You distribute the pieces of equipment you'll need on the otherside from the cart for members of the team to carry,
  and unload one of the A-frames.

As you proceed along the rim, you rotate carrying the A-frame between pairs of the crew.
Eventually, you reach the point across from where you'd left the rover, and strike camp early.

You awaken an break camp four hours before dawn, as soon as the sun's binary partner is high enough in the sky to see by.
You'll need as much time as possible to cross the canyon floor before the next nightfall.

The descent goes smoothly, and you reach the canyon floor just as the sky begins to lighten,
  although you won't see sunlight this far down for several hours yet.
The river at the bottom is more full than it was your first time,
  but you're able to find a route across,
  hopping between several large boulders that had come to rest there the night before.

The ascent proves more challenging.
It's not a technically demanding climb,
  but even acclimatized as you are to the low oxygen atmosphere,
  you find yourself panting from exertion,
  and need to rest frequently.

Nydia has much less trouble though,
  and ascends ahead of you to anchor ropes to the rock,
  making the climb easier.

All things considered, your party makes it up the other side without incident,
  and with nearly four hours of daylight remaining,
  you reach the rover, right where you left it covered in the tarp.

----

Time was kind to the small rover,
  and as you peel back the sediment-covered tarp concealing it you breathe a sigh of relief.
It's still here.

"Wow," you hear Coke comment behind you as you detach the anchors holding the rover firmly in place.
"You weren't kidding."

The batteries are still 60% charged, and you flash the headlights.
A quick check of the throttle causes the tires to spin out and kick up a bit of dust.

"Alright, looks like it still works!" you declare.

----

It takes a bit of work re-arranging the cargo,
  but you're able to hang some of it off the side with ropes,
  and eventually you're able to make room for the three halflings.

As you drive back to the chosen site,
  there's some kind of discussion,
  apparently about your rover,
  although there's some native terms you don't understand.
Right now the driving demands most of your attention though, so for now you just listen.

"Is this even gas powered? There's no engine noise," Nydia says.

"I don't know what else it could be, I don't even know if building a _jelnfya_ car would even be possible much less practical,"
  Coke replies, using a term you think you might've heard once before but don't really know.
"You'd need a crazy good _hojelnfyen_ or something and it wouldn't even last long enough to be worth it.
  And if it did it'd be crazy expensive even if &mdash;"

Morgan cuts her off. "Kai can probably just tell us how it works; Kai how does this rover thing work?"

"Hold on a moment." 
There's another bump as one of your wheels hits a rock and you have to avoid spinning out,
  but after a moment you reach a relatively open stretch and can spare enough attention to answer.
"It's electric. Although the term probably doesn't mean anything to you."

"_Jelnfya_," Nydia states, using that same term again, although saying it to nobody in particular.

"I dunno, maybe?
Tell you what,
  I can show you what's under the hood when I break it down to get it across the canyon."

Eventually the discussion turns.

Coke apparently flunked out of some kind of schooling before she wound up out here,
  though not for lack of trying.
She was supposedly quite adapt at the theory of whatever it was,
  and she'd flunked out due to some kind of "inability to perform" rather than any academic failing,
  although you weren't sure quite what it was she couldn't do.

Morgan, on the other hand, grew up in a clan farming kind of ocean-grown textile crop,
  and had basically gotten fed up and left that behind,
  just wandering to try to figure out what she actually wanted to do.

Nydia though... in some ways her story reminded you of your own, kinda.
Not really, the similarities ended pretty quick.
She'd grown up in an outlying settlement near what was apparently one of the largest cities on the planet,
  and had entered some kind of training program with an end goal of joining some sort of police force or perhaps militia.

But partway through, some kind of big civil war or coup had erupted and she'd been forced to flee,
  eventually winding up out here at what was apparely a fairly small settlement by her standards.
She'd largely cooled off from that idea of joining a city militia altogether though,
  after experiencing the petty corruption and minor injustices common out here.

Eventually though, the discussion turns to you.

"How about you, Kai? Where are you from" Morgan asks.

Your thoughts turn back to Earth, and the friends and family you left behind.

You'd joined the military right out of high school,
  and had been on a deployment around Jupiter when you'd recieved orders to reposition your vessel.
Where to didn't really matter at this point though;
  what mattered was that just as you were activating your hyperdrive,
  your vessel was knocked off-axis by some kind of debris,
  and by the time you'd realized it had been too late to abort,
  or to even correct your course quickly enough to avoid going interstellar.

Even if the hyperdrive hadn't been burned out by the correction you'd had to make to get _this_ intercept,
  even if you somehow could have flown back, over fifty years would've elapsed on Earth,
  but for you the scars were barely half a year old.

You hadn't even had a chance to say goodbye.
Relativity is a bitch.

You're really not ready to talk about it.

Fortunately, you soon arrive at the site,
  and you're able to brush off the question.

----

Jerry and Eli spot the cloud of dust kicked up by your vehicle,
  and by the time you come to a stop they're both waiting.

"Oooy!" Jerry calls across the canyon,
  his voice echoing back several times.

There's not enough daylight left to set up before nightfall,
  but it's good to see they too made it to their destination safely.

"Did you miss me?" you hollar back.

"Fat chance!" Eli calls, and that's that.

You strike camp on your side, and eventually the evening torrential rains cut off conversation.
Tomorrow, you will find out whether this entire idea was worthwhile.

----

In the morning, you assemble the kite, 
  and you assemble a crude kite from

- vehicles are quite valuable
- outline your plan
- based on my photos there's a point where the canyon narrows
- can string a rope across

You spend the next several hours communicating the issue, and outlining your plan to retrieve your rover and its contents.
Both of them seemed more than willing to help, or at least listen and comment.

With their help, you're able to procure a better map of the canyon network.
You already have some photographs from orbit, but they don't show enough detail concrete plans around.

Fortunately, maps _are_ available, and after some work you're able to find and purchase a suitable survey map of the canyon network.
Odds are the canyon has eroded some since that survey, but it will work for your purposes.

Using the map, you identify a suitable point where the canyon narrows enough to make your concept feasible,
  and assemble a list of everything you'll need.

----

You pull yourself up over the canyon edge, and pant for a moment.
You've acclimatized to the lower oxygen and were able to cross the canyon floor fairly quickly.

As the three other halflings reach the top, you start pulling up the rope attached to the steel A-frame.

Most of the heavy pieces of equipment &mdash; the steel cable, the transfer pulleys, etc. &mdash;
  are at the chosen site on the other side of the canyon,
  but there was but there was no avoiding the need to carry the A-frame and cable anchors across by hand.
You'd left it there with Jerry and Eli;
  Jerry had seemed the most competent with the rigging when you'd practiced the procedure earlier on flat ground.

Unfortunately, there hadn't been anywhere near the chosen site that could be easily crossed.
After dropping off the heavy cable and most of the equipment,
  it took two days to hike to the point where you'd crossed before after abandoning your rover.

Now though, you are across, with Morgan and Nydia, and &mdash;
  assuming it's still there &mdash; only about a hundred yards from the rover.

----

The rover is in nearly as good shape as when you left it, nearly a month ago,
  and with it you're able to make it back to the chosen site well before nightfall.

As you approach the rocky outcrop, you call across the canyon to the other half of your team.
"Ahoy!"
Your voice echoes back from the canyon wall,
  and you spot the A-frame on the other side where you'd anchored it in place.

After a moment, Jerry steps up next to it and hollars back.
"Did you miss us?"

You strike camp for the night.

----

Morning comes, and the winds are favorable.
You assemble a small kite from a thin wire,
  and after a few false starts Nydia manages to fly it far enough across for Eli to catch the string.
The string is used to pull a larger rope, and then that rope is used to pull the steel cable.

The steel cable is strung across the top of both A-frames and anchored firmly into the rock on either side,
  and pulled tight on the far end using a manual winch.
At last, it's in place,
  and you pull on a smaller thin rope. With it comes a large pulley, running on the steel cable, bearing a hook.

Over the next few hours you unload your rover and place the items into nets that you rig to the hook.
The parcels are pulled across to the other side and detached, and the hook pulled back empty.

Eventually, you're left with just the rover.
Rig it to the pulley, pull it across.


  which are pulled across by the crew on the other side and unloaded.


  and at last, you're able to pull on a 



Your plan to fly a small kite across the canyon worked, and 



You camp on the rocky outcrop, signaling to Jerry and Eli that you've made it with a small signal mirror.
Four bright flashes back indicates they got your signal.

Half-inch steel wire rope, 250 feet.
Or the next larger local size, anyway.
Like the language, the units here are a mess, but you have spotted steel cable in use supporting the domes of the city,
  clearly it _is_ available here.

Fortunately, steel wire rope _is_ available here.
You've run the numbers, and while something like nylon would have worked,
  you would have needed a rope over an inch and a half thick.
Half-inch steel cable is much easier to

nylon rope is available. 1 3/4 nylon is 2.7 tons weighs 0.780 lb/ft

kai, morgan, jerry; and also nydia, one of the othe two from the work crew

have aquired a better survey map of the canyon network
marked the position of the buggy and also best guess for the pod since they asked
go several miles upstream with the buggy to a point where the span is much shorter

how is stuff transported? pack animals? wagon? palanquin carried betwen two people?


practice how to do it, to make sure they knew what to do
launch rope across the gorge, tow a bigger cable plus another small cable across
both sides set up a-frame footer and dig a sand anchor
signal mirror flash to launching side indicating it's anchored, ready to tension the main cable
use small rope to pull payload attached to pulley across the canyon on the main cable

Similar principle to breeches buoy process. Reference reenactments on youtube.

Party of five: Kai, morgan, jerry, nydia, eli, coke
