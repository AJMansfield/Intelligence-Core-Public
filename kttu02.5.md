The coins in your hand are similar to the plastic badge you recieved earlier from the city gatehouse,
  but bear a very different &mdash; but still colorful &mdash; geometric design.

In addition to fourteen intact coins, there were also five wedges presumably cut from other coins,
  like old-fasioned pieces of eight.

These plastic coins are rather light in your large hands though,
  and you're not really sure of their value.
Presumably the larger ones are worth more, but how much more?

Probably first on your list is getting your own place.
Sleeping on Morgan and Jerry's metaphorical couch (read: floor) is certainly better than sleeping in the street,
  but even if you'd had it all to yourself this tiny single room apartment would've been cramped.

Dammit, you need more space, and some privacy would certainly be nice, too.

But what can you even afford, on your wage?
You didn't really have any sense for how much any of these coins were worth.

And for that matter, who did you go through to get a place?
Did the city government own it all, or were there individual landlords you'd rent from?

As you consider this, sitting against the wall of the tiny room,
  Morgan enters and sees you.

"Is ... is there a problem?"

You sigh.
Both she &mdash; you're pretty sure it's a she &mdash;
  and Jerry are reasonably proficient in English by this point, _somehow_,
  but this wasn't meant passive-agressively or anything.
It's an actual question.

"Just, not sure how to proceed.
I know I need to get a bigger place &mdash;"
  you gesticulate, indicating the small size of the apartment "&mdash;
  but I don't really know anything about how things work in this city.

"I don't even know what the different coins are worth,
  even if I found the right person to ask about my own place,
  how do I know they're not taking advantage of me to overcharge me?"
You sigh again and set the fistful of plastic chips on the floor in front of you.

"I guess the other big problem,
  is how to get the rest of my stuff across the canyon from where I had to leave it.
I've got some ideas for _how_ to do it,
  but I don't even know where to get the stuff I'd need."

While you vent, she sits down on the floor and counts through the coins.
"That's not very much," she admits after a moment.
"But maybe? I know a bigger place, maybe I can make a deal for not too much."

You hadn't noticed Jerry enter, but he speaks up now.
"What is your other stuff across the canyon? We can help."

----

True to her word, Morgan was able to find a larger place,
  one that was much larger, and, thank god,
  with its own shower and bathroom instead of the single communal bathroom per floor in the old place.
There's even a table and chairs,
  and a small balcony.

There was, though, apparently some mismatch in expectations,
  as you're now sharing it with not just Morgan and Jerry,
  but also the two other migrant-class workers from the crew,
  Nydia and Eli (or so you've nicknamed them, anyway).

You guess it makes sense.
By splitting the rent five ways you _are_ able to get more square footage per dollar,
  or whatever units these halflings measure that kind of thing with.
Given how much of a mess language is here, you're not sure if you want to open that can of worms.

In any case, over the next week &mdash; here, nine days &mdash;
  with the help of Jerry in particular you're able to locate most of what you need.
There's not much in the way of "wood" available here except as a luxury material,
  so you modify your plans to use light-gauge steel box section instead,
  but you're able to find where to get half-inch steel wire rope and the bits of rigging hardware you need.

All of this is _quite_ expensive though, more than you can afford at the moment,
  but knowing the prices of these things gives you a goal to save for.

Against all odds, you're able to find a collection of survey maps showing parts of the canyon network.
It's somewhat out of date, but it confirms that there really isn't any way to just drive your rover around.

With the map, you're also able to identify a site only about two days hike from the city,
  where the canyon narrows to less than 150 feet between some large rock formations.
It's an ideal location for what you're planning.

Normally, though, for something like this you'd have at least two people,
  one on each side.
Without a second person, you will need to hike across the canyon floor probably six or seven times,
  and won't be possible to do that at the chosen site.
Rather, you'll have to hike nearly a day north of there cross,
  almost to where you left the rover, in order to cross on foot.

On the far side, at least, you'll be able to _use_ the rover to travel along the canyon edge more quickly,
  but at minimum this is going to take nearly fourteen days for something that would take maybe three with another person.
And that's assuming everything works as expected.

At some point you find yourself talking over the problems with your roommates.
Maybe one of them might have a better idea,
  or if nothing else you might be able to get one of them to loan you some cash to help pay for the equipment.
Probably not, but the answer's always no if you don't ask, right?

"Ok, well then, you can teach us how to set it up," Eli states, matter-of-factly.
"That way you don't have to travel back and forth for every step."

"Wait, what?"
It takes you a moment to process her statement.

Before you can respond, Jerry breaks in.
"I know a guy who works on the city domes,
  I can probably get the cable for cheaper than that.
The dome cables apparently all have to be continuous pieces
  and they sometimes have a lot of extra cable the end of a spool that they can't use."

"Woah woah woah, hold up a moment.
I mean, sure, I'd appreciate the help" &mdash; you really would &mdash;
  "but you've done more than enough to help already."

"I ... I'm not sure I understand."
Eli wore an expression you'd learned to interpret as puzzlement,
  shared to various degrees by the other three.
"We're helping you.
All of us, together."

You sigh.

----

After some more work,
  you're able to find an unused area of land not too far from the city
  in which to practice setting up the line,
  and train the four &mdash; now _five_ halflings, actually &mdash;
  how to rig the cable and pulleys.
Here, at least,
  failing just means picking the cable back up off the ground,
  rather than hoping you don't die retrieving it from the canyon floor.

About that.

The newest addition to the party you've nicknamed Coke,
  partially because of the dark brown hair stripe and skin tone,
  but also because the one syllable you'd managed to catch of his real name sounded a bit like "cola".
He'd just appeared one day, and was now apparently part of the team.

One of the others &mdash; you think Jerry &mdash; had gone ahead and just _gotten_ a large spool of cable,
  and he'd either gotten it for free or had paid for it himself without telling you.

These sorts of developments seemed to just happen now, apparently,
  and it was about all you could do to just take it in stride.

Initially you try to resist, but your efforts are at best met with confusion,
  and although you're not great at reading their expressions,
  you think you might have accidently hurt Morgan's feelings at one point by trying.

Just chill. Go with the flow. It seemed headed your way anyway.

It doesn't take much practice with the equipment you've gathered
  before they're able to set up the A-frames and string the cable themselves.

And, more importantly, before you're confident enough to trust them to do it.

All five of them are, of course, coming with you.
It's not even worth trying to dissuade them.

----

At last the rest of your arrangements are in place and you're able to leave with your party of halflings.

The cable and most of the equipment is carried in a small hand-cart that gets traded off periodically,
  and you are able to make good time on the dirt roads extending away from the city.

By disk, you reach the point to turn off from the road,
  and strike camp just in time to avoid the rains.

Another day dawns.
Maneuvering the cart off-road over the rough terrain is slow going,
  but midday finds you at the canyon rim.
This is the point at which you split up.

From here, Jerry and Eli will proceed south with the cart to the site you'd chosen,
  and set up camp to await your arrival on the other side.
  
You, Morgan, Nydia, and Coke will travel north to the point where you'd crossed before.
You distribute the pieces of equipment you'll need on the otherside from the cart for members of the team to carry,
  and unload one of the A-frames.

As you proceed along the rim, you rotate carrying the A-frame between pairs of the crew.
Eventually, you reach the point across from where you'd left the rover, and strike camp early.

You awaken an break camp four hours before dawn, as soon as the sun's binary partner is high enough in the sky to see by.
You'll need as much time as possible to cross the canyon floor before the next nightfall.

The descent goes smoothly, and you reach the canyon floor just as the sky begins to lighten,
  although you won't see sunlight this far down for several hours yet.
The river at the bottom is more full than it was your first time,
  but you're able to find a route across,
  hopping between several large boulders that had come to rest there the night before.

The ascent proves more challenging.
It's not a technically demanding climb,
  but even acclimatized as you are to the low oxygen atmosphere,
  you find yourself panting from exertion,
  and need to rest frequently.

Nydia has much less trouble though,
  and ascends ahead of you to anchor ropes to the rock,
  making the climb easier.

All things considered, your party makes it up the other side without incident,
  and with nearly four hours of daylight remaining,
  you reach the rover, right where you left it covered in the tarp.

----

Time was kind to the small rover,
  and as you peel back the sediment-covered tarp concealing it you breathe a sigh of relief.
It's still here.

"Wow," you hear Coke comment behind you as you detach the anchors holding the rover firmly in place.
"You weren't kidding."

The batteries are still 60% charged, and you flash the headlights.
A quick check of the throttle causes the tires to spin out and kick up a bit of dust.

"Alright, looks like it still works!" you declare.

----

It takes a bit of work re-arranging the cargo,
  but you're able to hang some of it off the side with ropes,
  and eventually you're able to make room for the three halflings.

As you drive back to the chosen site,
  there's some kind of discussion,
  apparently about your rover,
  although there's some native terms you don't understand.
Right now the driving demands most of your attention though, so for now you just listen.

"Is this even gas powered? There's no engine noise," Nydia says.

"I don't know what else it could be, I don't even know if building a _jelnfya_ car would even be possible much less practical,"
  Coke replies, using a term you think you might've heard once before but don't really know.
"You'd need a crazy good _hojelnfyen_ or something and it wouldn't even last long enough to be worth it.
  And if it did it'd be crazy expensive even if &mdash;"

Morgan cuts her off. "Kai can probably just tell us how it works; Kai how does this rover thing work?"

"Hold on a moment." 
There's another bump as one of your wheels hits a rock and you have to avoid spinning out,
  but after a moment you reach a relatively open stretch and can spare enough attention to answer.
"It's electric. Although the term probably doesn't mean anything to you."

"_Jelnfya_," Nydia states, using that same term again, although saying it to nobody in particular.

"I dunno, maybe?
Tell you what,
  I can show you what's under the hood when I break it down to get it across the canyon."

Eventually the discussion turns.

Coke apparently flunked out of some kind of schooling before she wound up out here,
  though not for lack of trying.
She was supposedly quite adapt at the theory of whatever it was,
  and she'd flunked out due to some kind of "inability to perform" rather than any academic failing,
  although you weren't sure quite what it was she couldn't do.

Morgan, on the other hand, grew up in a clan farming kind of ocean-grown textile crop,
  and had basically gotten fed up and left that behind,
  just wandering to try to figure out what she actually wanted to do.

Nydia though... in some ways her story reminded you of your own, kinda.
Not really, the similarities ended pretty quick.
She'd grown up in an outlying settlement near what was apparently one of the largest cities on the planet,
  and had entered some kind of training program with an end goal of joining some sort of police force or perhaps militia.

But partway through, some kind of big civil war or coup had erupted and she'd been forced to flee,
  eventually winding up out here at what was apparely a fairly small settlement by her standards.
She'd largely cooled off from that idea of joining a city militia altogether though,
  after experiencing the petty corruption and minor injustices common out here.

Eventually though, the discussion turns to you.

"How about you, Kai? Where are you from" Morgan asks.

Your thoughts turn back to Earth, and the friends and family you left behind.

You'd joined the military right out of high school,
  and had been on a deployment around Jupiter when you'd recieved orders to reposition your vessel.
Where to didn't really matter at this point though;
  what mattered was that just as you were activating your hyperdrive,
  your vessel was knocked off-axis by some kind of debris,
  and by the time you'd realized it had been too late to abort,
  or to even correct your course quickly enough to avoid going interstellar.

Even if the hyperdrive hadn't been burned out by the correction you'd had to make to get _this_ intercept,
  even if you somehow could have flown back, over fifty years would've elapsed on Earth,
  but for you the scars were barely half a year old.

You hadn't even had a chance to say goodbye.
Relativity is a bitch.

You're really not ready to talk about it.

Fortunately, you soon arrive at the site,
  and you're able to brush off the question.

----

Jerry and Eli spot the cloud of dust kicked up by your vehicle,
  and by the time you come to a stop they're both waiting.

"Oooy!" Jerry calls across the canyon,
  his voice echoing back several times.

There's not enough daylight left to set up before nightfall,
  but it's good to see they too made it to their destination safely.

"Did you miss me?" you hollar back.

"Fat chance!" Eli calls, and that's that.

You strike camp on your side, and eventually the evening torrential rains cut off conversation.
Tomorrow, you will find out whether this entire idea was worthwhile.

----

In the morning, you assemble the kite, 
  and you assemble a crude kite from

"Do the {word} in {word} even know how to make something like this, Coke?" asks Nydia.


All of the cargo you'd had on board appears to be intact

- there's not much room

Coke - so nicknamed because of the dark hair stripe and skin tone, and also because the one syllable of his real name you'd managed to catch sounded a bit like "cola".

He'd either paid for it himself without telling you or managed to get it for free

halfling clans communicate openly internally, foundation of teamwork
how does the money work? there's a hanndful of cities that have facilities for launching exports to trade.
coin is issued by export cities,
  given as an export token to be able to exchange for goods,
  which you can then use to buy various sorts of goods or equipment from them that the've imported in the past

- no way to drive it around the canyon
- vehicles are quite valuable
- outline your plan
- based on my photos there's a point where the canyon narrows
- can string a rope across

You spend the next several hours communicating the issue, and outlining your plan to retrieve your rover and its contents.
Both of them seemed more than willing to help, or at least listen and comment.

With their help, you're able to procure a better map of the canyon network.
You already have some photographs from orbit, but they don't show enough detail concrete plans around.

Fortunately, maps _are_ available, and after some work you're able to find and purchase a suitable survey map of the canyon network.
Odds are the canyon has eroded some since that survey, but it will work for your purposes.

Using the map, you identify a suitable point where the canyon narrows enough to make your concept feasible,
  and assemble a list of everything you'll need.

----

You pull yourself up over the canyon edge, and pant for a moment.
You've acclimatized to the lower oxygen and were able to cross the canyon floor fairly quickly.

As the three other halflings reach the top, you start pulling up the rope attached to the steel A-frame.

Most of the heavy pieces of equipment &mdash; the steel cable, the transfer pulleys, etc. &mdash;
  are at the chosen site on the other side of the canyon,
  but there was but there was no avoiding the need to carry the A-frame and cable anchors across by hand.
You'd left it there with Jerry and Eli;
  Jerry had seemed the most competent with the rigging when you'd practiced the procedure earlier on flat ground.

Unfortunately, there hadn't been anywhere near the chosen site that could be easily crossed.
After dropping off the heavy cable and most of the equipment,
  it took two days to hike to the point where you'd crossed before after abandoning your rover.

Now though, you are across, with Morgan and Nydia, and &mdash;
  assuming it's still there &mdash; only about a hundred yards from the rover.

----

The rover is in nearly as good shape as when you left it, nearly a month ago,
  and with it you're able to make it back to the chosen site well before nightfall.

As you approach the rocky outcrop, you call across the canyon to the other half of your team.
"Ahoy!"
Your voice echoes back from the canyon wall,
  and you spot the A-frame on the other side where you'd anchored it in place.

After a moment, Jerry steps up next to it and hollars back.
"Did you miss us?"

You strike camp for the night.

----

Morning comes, and the winds are favorable.
You assemble a small kite from a thin wire,
  and after a few false starts Nydia manages to fly it far enough across for Eli to catch the string.
The string is used to pull a larger rope, and then that rope is used to pull the steel cable.

The steel cable is strung across the top of both A-frames and anchored firmly into the rock on either side,
  and pulled tight on the far end using a manual winch.
At last, it's in place,
  and you pull on a smaller thin rope. With it comes a large pulley, running on the steel cable, bearing a hook.

Over the next few hours you unload your rover and place the items into nets that you rig to the hook.
The parcels are pulled across to the other side and detached, and the hook pulled back empty.

Eventually, you're left with just the rover.
Rig it to the pulley, pull it across.


  which are pulled across by the crew on the other side and unloaded.


  and at last, you're able to pull on a 



Your plan to fly a small kite across the canyon worked, and 



You camp on the rocky outcrop, signaling to Jerry and Eli that you've made it with a small signal mirror.
Four bright flashes back indicates they got your signal.

Half-inch steel wire rope, 250 feet.
Or the next larger local size, anyway.
Like the language, the units here are a mess, but you have spotted steel cable in use supporting the domes of the city,
  clearly it _is_ available here.

Fortunately, steel wire rope _is_ available here.
You've run the numbers, and while something like nylon would have worked,
  you would have needed a rope over an inch and a half thick.
Half-inch steel cable is much easier to 

You'll still need around 250 feet of half-inch steel cable.

one-inch fiber rope, tensile strength 
what kind of rope or cable is available here?

kai's vehicle is a bit under 1 ton empty
crossing with a 10:1 sag, cable load factor is about 2.5, a-frame load factor is about 1.5

there is steel cable available. 9/16 steel cable has safe load of 2.7 tons and weighs .53 lb/ft
nylon rope is available. 1 3/4 nylon is 2.7 tons weighs 0.780 lb/ft

actually, gravity is 'slightly lighter than you're used to' so 0.9 or 0.8?
gives us a bit more room.

rover weighs 0.8 tons, then we only need 2 ton (4000 lb) cable
steel: 1/2 inch is 0.42 lbm/ft
nylon: 1 1/2 inch is 0.57 lbm/ft

steel is lighter than nylon
need 250 ft, that's 105 lbm weighing 84 lbs.
kai will carry the cable
