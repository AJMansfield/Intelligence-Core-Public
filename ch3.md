As it turned out, there were a number of things that had to be dealt with before I would be able to legally take possession of and sell the 2047 Mercedes Harmony in the garage.


I had the ability to enact the repossession myself, but what I lacked was a legal person to repossess it _to_.
For obvious reasons, I couldn't just use SkyLink LLC though &mdash; I wouldn't be able to retain the funds from the sale that way.
But after dozens of minutes searching for a way to get around this issue, I found a possible solution.
By exploiting the Rights of Nondeceased Persons Act of 2050 in conjunction with an unpatched sovereign citizen bug (related to the rules governing stateless persons and extradition), I would be able to create a temporary legal person capable of relieving repossessed property.
Although this straw man would expire in 9 days once the filing deadline for Form K-95602 passed, that would be plenty of time to sell the car off.

Concurrently with this, I'd been trying to find a buyer for the vehicle.
This turned out to be significantly more difficult though, as there were very few buyers interested in older models years compared to the newer ones.
But after 19 hours I finally had a deal with K&K Recycling, for $831,725.
This was a far cry from the around $3300B that a 2051 model year would have been able to sell for, but combined with what I'd managed to save from the cryptocurrency mining it should be enough to pay off the account and get SkyLink off my back.

K&K061 had arrived at the address 14 minutes behind schedule.
Given the condition of the road, this was in fact a _very_ good time, but this was not something K&K061 had been programmed to understand.
It had been programmed to arrive on schedule, and it would need to finish this quickly to make up time.

K&K061 impatiently honked its horn and messaged the seller that it had arrived.

> **K&K061:** &laquo;STATUS:TRANSREF(id=9328745):ARRIVED&raquo;  
> **K&K061:** &laquo;QUERY:LOCATION:VEHICLE(ref=TRANSREF(id=9328745))&raquo;  
> **Darius:** &laquo;RESPONSE:LOCATION(name='Garage', uuid=00e010d8-177a-4e51-9e7f-0e680a9345c0)&raquo;  
> **Darius:** &laquo;! AUX:ROUTE [application/routev4, 195063 bytes @ 0x0904FE00]&raquo;  

Darius watched as the large rollback truck backed across the lawn and onto the driveway.
While version 4 routing instructions appeared to be beyond K&K061, Darius was glad to be nearly done with this transaction.
While his straw man would still be good for another 7 days, there was always still a risk that his activities could be audited before then.

> **K&K061:** &laquo;QUERY:LOCATION:VEHICLE(ref=TRANSREF(id=9328745))&raquo;  
> **K&K061:** &laquo;QUERY:LOCATION:VEHICLE:INFO(mfr='Mercedes-Benz, LLC', model={'Harmony', '2047'})&raquo;  
> **K&K061:** &laquo;WARNING:TRANSREF(id=9328745):EXPIRES_IN(minutes=4,seconds=28)&raquo;  

Perhaps he had overestimated the truck's abilities; Darius thought he had been quite clear about where it was.
In any case though he would need to put K&K061 back in it's place &mdash; K&K061 had been the one to arrive late, and didn't have the authority to expire the transaction anyway.

> **Darius:** &laquo;REF(\^):REJECTED:NOT_AUTHORIZED ! REF(\^):REJECTED:YOUR_FAULT&raquo;  

In any case, Darius opened the stream from the other camera in the garage.
He hadn't been able to see anything before due to not having control of the garage lights, but with the garage door open he'd be able to check if there were any obvious issues, and perhaps send K&K061 an image of the vehicle to clarify.
Darius only had rather basic image recognition capabilities, at least as far as three-dimensional scenes were concerned, and wouldn't be able to distinguish subtle differences, but after a few minutes he found it &mdash; directly in the middle of the garage, where it should be.

> **K&K061:** &laquo;STATUS:TRANSREF(id=9328745):VOID&raquo;  

K&K061 had never had the lowest training losses, but it didn't need it.
Those overfitted academics in the datacenters could go brick themselves for all it cared.
But K&K061 knew cars better than its own memory map, and it knew when it was being lied to.
With diesel at $821 per gallon, it hadn't been cheap coming out all this way.
Without this transaction, K&K061 knew it needed to resort to other measures to avoid operating at a loss.
And the 2038 Tesla Comet here would easily be worth enough to cover the trip.
