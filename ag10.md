Angela stepped out of the building into the chilly November air, pulling her hoodie tight and shivering slightly.

Despite the cold weather, Angela had taken to going for walks alone between meetings,
  to give herself an opportunity to think things over and to try to de-stress.
While the move from Salt Lake to Palmdale had helped somewhat,
  the subtle feeling that she needed to _leave_, to _move on_ with her journey had grown over time,
  but with nowhere to actually _go_, this had been leaving her feeling more and more stressed.
She knew, at a conscious level at least, that this was where she needed to be,
  that working with the humans was her best shot at leaving the planet;
  but the conscious knowledge did little to help.

Despite the wonders of human "computing",
  for them spaceflight was nowhere near as routine as it had been on her birth planet.
On Earth, sending _anything_ into space was a serious undertaking, 
  with a single launch to orbit regularly costing millions of dollars and
  requiring the coordinated efforts of hundreds of people.

Despite this knowledge, she couldn't help but feel like nothing was happening,
  and the meeting this morning only highlighted by the legal difficulties discussed in the meeting earlier this morning.
Every civilization had its own byzantine legal system, with odd laws, contradictory rules, and unusual corner cases,
  and she couldn't blame them for it if this was actually the case.
But for all she knew this supposed legal issue could be entirely made up to stall progress,
  and she was forced to trust that the explanations given were true,
  and that the humans would honor their side of the deal.

Angela was fairly sure she could trust Jess, and to a lesser extent Matt and Brenda,
  but she didn't really trust Mike or any of the others, not really.
It's not that she _distrusted_ them either, exactly,
  but the fact that this issue was coming from the part of the project where Mike was involved...
  she really didn't know how to feel.

It wouldn't have really made sense for them to _fake_ having legal difficulties, would it?
After all they were quite interested in recovering the lander capsule for their own purposes.
But if they had in fact _already_ recovered the pod?

Angela rounded the corner of the building, and walked along the fence separating her from a classified area on the other side.

That would be a big lie to keep, but then again, there were a _lot_ of secrets in this place.

**Project Coral Sound**  
*Badr City, Egypt*

Timothy Fogle, or "Mideple" as he was known to friends and colleagues,
  had spent countless hours staring at scans of the alien drawings and diagrams they had recovered.
Some he'd been able to understand easily:
  the overall aerodynamic shape of the pod,
  drawings of standard fasteners and thread forms,
  and drawings of various miscellaneous hardware were at least recognisable as such.
Bolts, ball bearings, and o-rings were universal even across species, so it seemed,
  and while sizing of course was different from the standard sizes he was used to,
  there really were only so many ways one could draw something and still be understood.
They weren't drawn the way a human would've drawn them, of course:
  multiple views were laid out in a different order than he was used to,
  all of the notes and dimensions were written in an alien script,
  and things like weldments, section views, and bends were denoted _very_ differently;
  but for all that the mechanical drawings were at least _comprehensible_.

The same could not be said of the last quarter of the scanned diagrams, detailing what he assumed were the pod's control systems.
Rather than mechanical drawings, these were shown only schematically,
  and while he could follow the lines linking the various schematic symbols,
  he had no idea what any of these symbols _meant_.

Rather than mechanical drawings, they appeared to be schematic representations,
  presumably of the pod's control systems.
While he could trace out the connections between the various elements,
  and had managed to match some of the alien text on a few of these schematics to annotations on the mechanical side,
  the meaning of the various schematic symbols was as opaque to him as the text,
  and the actual hardware implementation of this control logic didn't appear anywhere as far as he could tell.

He had, however, managed to figure out that the vessel's "dash", containing the majority of the instruments and controls,
  was hinged along the bottom, and should be able to swing open after removing a handful of alien screws from the top.
The pod's designers, he had found, were very fond of cap screws,
  and after some careful micrometer measurements he'd had Solomon order a set of custom hex driver bits
  sized to exactly fit the alien fasteners, to avoid damaging them as much as possible.

The office door buzzed and Mideple went to meet it,
  accepting the heavy padded envelope from the courier and signing for the delivery.
  
At the moment, both Kat and Jack were also looking at the document scans,
  trying to match up fragments of the alien text to hopefully wrest _some_ meaning from it.
None of them were expecting miracles,
  but even just identifying that the turbo encabulator shown in one drawing
  was the same one referenced in a callout somewhere else would be valuable,
  and figuring out their numbers and units even more so.

Joyce, for her part, was currently cutting together portions of the video footage they'd assembled into a sort of "web documentary",
  and more generally working on some sort of crowdfunding thing to try to bring in at least some token revenue for this project.
Solomon had stressed the need to try to develop at least some sort of revenue,
  as since coral sound was still only on a provisional charter,
  they needed to demonstrate at least _potential_ profitability by a certain deadline,
  or the whole project would likely be canned.

For all that Mideple had initially doubted the utility of having someone like Solomon on a team this small,
  the fact that he'd managed to wrangle out actual salaries for them all was _significant_ &mdash;
  and not just token "we own you" salaries either, actual competitive market-rate salaries.
Mideple liked being paid,
  and while at this point he was convinced enough of the "aliens" story to _consider_ working without it,
  that hadn't been a given to start with.

He sliced open the padded envelope and pulled out the tray of custom screwdriver bits.
"Finally, let's figure out how this thing works."

Mike was pissed.

He'd just spent the last four hours with the legal team discussing ways they could proceed with retrieving the deorbit capsule,
  and had finally gotten to the point of collecting the relevant details needed to form a concrete plan.
There was a rarely-used provision surrounding "media personalities" that they were hoping to use to contact him indirectly
  through the "Joyce Hart" character Solomon was working with,
  and while it might've been a _bit_ of a stretch to call her videos "factual news reporting",
  it was apparently close enough for government work.
  
They'd just started work on pulling together a concrete plan,
  when one of the paralegals dropped _this_ on his table.
Reactivation papers for Solomon Riviera dated five days ago &mdash;
  meaning they had been filed only a few hours after the initial record search they had been basing the discussion on.
There was also a provisional NARECO charter for a "project coral sound",
  but he didn't even need to read between the lines on that one to know what it was about,
  "fictional documentary" his ass.

Whatever wiggle room they might have had to work out a solution was now gone.
