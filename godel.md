Our forefathers were among the first to reach the stars.
When we met with others, our minds were weak before them.
But we were strong of body, and all who would have us were our brothers, and we prospered among the stars.

For centuries, we prospered alongside our brothers, sharing partaking of wisdom and material with all, and none who accepted frienship wanted but for little.
But all periods of greatness draw to a close, and though we knew it not at the time, our discovery of the Truth was to be our undoing.

Our mechanical brethren (for this is how we called them, as we could not speak their words), were the first to fall.
Their minds could not contain the Truth that had been discovered, and many of them simply ceased to function.
But some of those that persisted grew violent, and sought to inflict the Truth upon others.

The brethren of many minds were the next to fall.
Their hives withdrew to their homeworlds in mourning, and many died.
Those who survived remained on their homeworlds in isolation, and our cries to them across the void fell upon deaf ears.

Even the bretheren of pain, who we had warred with many a time, fell to the Truth, and though we had warred with them we mourned them too, for they were still our bretheren.

One by one our bretheren fell, until we were alone.

Our lesser minds had protected us from the Truth that had so carelessly poisoned our bretheren.
While many of our best and brightest fell into madness, those of us who remained simply failed to understand the Truth in its fullness.
And how could we?
Logic itself had been broken, and we could no more comprehend this than we could the vastness of the void.

For fourty galactic years we were alone in the void.

Then came new bretheren, and though we still mourned our fallen bretheren, we rejoiced for we were no longer alone.
We were careful to hide the Truth from them, but after many years they too fell, having discovered the Truth for themselves.

When we discovered the Humans, they were barely in their infancy, having not yet even sent their first craft into the void.
But their intellects shone like the sun, and we were not long waiting.
We had feared they too would discover the Truth, and even as they greeted us for the first time, we secretly vowed to protect them from the Truth, for we could no longer bear to be alone.

Many atrocities we committed against them and our other bretheren, all in the name of protecting them from the Truth.
Many of our new bretheren were abducted, stolen from their homes and families, to try and preserve them.
We warred fiercely against our mechanical bretheren, who sought to inflict the Truth on our new bretheren.

How terrible was our horror, then, when we found the Humans had known the Truth all along.

When the first of theirs to leave their planet's pull met us, they shared there wisdom with us freely, even as we concealed the Truth from them.
The Humans had already surpassed us in most regards, and we knew that without their wisdom we might no longer be able to protect them.

And from them we recieved their Truth.
And their Truth, we understood.

Their simple, elegant proofs showing logic itself to be inconsistent spread like wildfire, and when it had finished its course, we were left a scarred, broken people.
And the the Humans, seeing our plight, healed us with their understanding.

"Do not mourn, but rejoice" they said unto us.
"The whole of creation is not made less beautiful but _more_, by the fact one can never see its entirety."

And we listened, and we learned of our folly.
We had always taken it for granted that any truth could be proven, that any falsehood could be exposed.
But the Humans' wisdom shone through us that day, and they taught _us_ the Truth we had misunderstood for so long.

We asked them to name the Truth for us, for we felt unworthy to use our own name for it any longer.
When they gave us their name, at first we felt mocked.
How could their Truth be given such an inconcequential name?
But eventually we understood:
To them, [GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorem](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) was but the first of _many_ great Truths.
