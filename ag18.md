Solomon sat in a cafe on the upper deck of the airport terminal,
  idly watching the crowd below file through security as he ate.
Lines were short this morning, and his flight wasn't until nine,
  but for the moment he had nowhere better to be,
  and not enough time to do anything more.

In any case, watching crowds could be fun.

At the moment Oscar the Grouch towed his girlfriend behind him,
  irritated that he couldn't feel irritated about the length of the line.

Karen from Accounting _didn't_ end up speaking with the checkpoint guard's manager,
  but she made it clear she had a Very Important Appointment waiting for her on the other side.

And Jabba the Hutt trailed a line of squealing jawas behind her.
Han Solo followed behind, looking like he'd rather still be frozen in carbonite.

The slice of toast gave a satisfying *crunch* as Solomon bit into it,
  the sweetness of the jam combining with the caramelized flavors of the toasted bread,
  complimenting the cheap but not unpleasant flavor of the coffee in the cup next to it.

Solomon reviewed his plans on his laptop,
  navigating through different pieces of information in his virtual crazy wall software,
  updating it with information from emails he'd received last night.
  
A letter from a middle manager in one of the launch partners indicating &mdash; in far too many words &mdash;
  that something-or-other relating to labor practices had general support and would be able to go to a vote.

Another indicated that the proposed revisions to the aerospace aluminum tariff schedule had gone through,
  securing Solomon's end of a bargain with another supplier.

It wasn't all good news, unfortunately.
The project review board's report had included an extra finding he'd hoped they'd omit,
  and while he already had a scapegoat lined up, that was going to cost him a few favors.

Just more byzantine corporate politics.

Down below, Pee-Wee Harris had forgotten to to put his knife in his checked bag with the rest of his troop,
  and one of the older boy scouts took him back to help him Fed-Ex it home.

Shama Biswas glanced around in her green hoodie as a guard opened her bag for a search,
  and for a moment she looked like she was about to try reaching in to palm something.

Flava Flav made a lewd comment at one of the security guards as he waddled past with his pants sagging nearly to the knee,
  and earned himself and his sideways baseball hat a complimentary secondary screening and an escort over to one side.

And Arnold Schwarzenegger presented some kind of badge as he pulled a holster out of jacket,
  placing it and the large handgun inside it on the conveyor belt.

Overall, it looked like Solomon's political maneuverings were about to pay off.
There was still a chance he'd be saddled with an administrator if his business in New York didn't pan out,
  but even if so he was pretty confident he knew who they'd saddle him with.
  he might not like it but he could at least work with them.

The waitress came by to refill his coffee,
  and Solomon was mid-sentence asking for another plate of toast
  when something suddenly snagged in the back of his mind.

He froze, and quickly looked back down over the edge of the balcony.

For some reason Schwarzenegger had been held up,
  and the guard had called over a superior to verify the document or badge he'd presented.
He was clearly becoming very agitated,
  trying to pay attention to something on the other side of the checkpoint,
  while simultaneously having to pay attention to the guards to resolve the holdup.

Solomon followed his gaze just in time to see Green Hoodie disappear into the crowd,
  getting a glimpse of her face as she glanced back towards the checkpoint.

And there it was.

Solomon realized he'd stopped mid-sentence,
  and he apologized to the waitress as he scrambled to pull up a picture.
"Sorry, give me a minute."

The one photo he'd managed to find that showed a face wasn't great,
  and he really hadn't gotten that good of a glance,
  but in many of the others she wore a _very_ similar green hoodie,
  and the build was _definitely_ a match.

--------

The feeling of being watched subsided as Angela got away from the checkpoint,
  and after a moment her bodyguard caught up.

It had been a stroke of luck when he'd been held up,
  giving her the perfect chance to retrieve some of her items from her bag without him breathing down her neck.
She certainly hadn't been going to wait for him,
  and it would've been all the better if he'd somehow managed to lose her all on his own.

After a night's rest she was a lot more composed than she'd been the night before,
  but the nagging need to get away somehow was still very much present,
  and the lockpicks and notebook in her bag weighed heavily on her mind.

She didn't like to rely on magic &mdash;
  not after her failure under pressure with defending herself that in a way had led to _all of this_ &mdash;
  but she now had a lot more practice with a number of spells,
  after casting many of them repeatedly for the human's experiments.

She'd also spent some time to prepare several nearly-complete sigils in her notebook.
Preparing these sorts of incomplete spells was a bit tricky;
  you had to spend the time up front to do everything in a way that would make it easy to pick back up.
Even with that, you still needed at least a vague memory of what you were doing,
  but as long as you were able to recall it,
  it could be a significant time saver if you needed to be able to cast a more complex spell quickly.

Back on Kemhe, carrying a notebook with some of the sigils she'd drawn could get one in a _lot_ of trouble,
  but here on Earth there were only a handful of people that would even know what they were,
  much less try to stop her.

After a moment Angela got to the gate,
  and took a seat to wait for the flight.

Last night after reaching the breaking point,
  Angela had finally buckled down and texted Jess,
  pouring out everything that had been going on.

Her escalationg stress from working in the same few locations.
Echoes of her feelings of vulnerability after the incident four months ago.
How her need for security had twisted into a sort of paranoid fear.

The loss of control, her efforts to manage her stress, ideations about escaping and running away.
Even going so far as to lay out fragments of a plan,
  details she'd noticed about how to get past the security fence in Palmdale.
The map she'd put together of foot traffic around NIH,
  showing all the back entrances and broom closets and mechanical spaces of the main building where she usually worked.
Everything.

To what end she didn't know,
  but at that point she'd just been texting everything she could think of,
  hoping Jess would be able to help her.

Of all the humans she knew, Jess was probably the one she trusted most.
She'd been consistently sympathetic in the past,
  and was generally fairly outspoken in advocating for her interests,
  at least in the few meetings she went too.

Unfortunately, while Mike and Matt had both managed to find their niche within the project working with different teams,
  Jess hadn't really found a place where she could really do much,
  and had announced that she would return to school to finish her mechanical engineering degree next fall.

This had been a bit of a blow to Angela, but this was her decision;
  even if Angela _could_ convince her to stay, if Jess felt the need to move on it wouldn't be right to.

This was one of the main reasons she'd held off asking for help for so long,
  and Angela still felt bad about getting her involved in what was really a personal issue.

Well, she hadn't told her _everything_ everything.
She glanced behind her, to where her bodyguard stood a respectful distance away against a large pillar.

Going through security had been nerve-wracking,
  and while none of the items in her bag were strictly speaking against _their_ rules,
  it had been especially embarrassing when her bag had been searched.

She'd almost instinctively reached out to try to snag something from it when it had been opened,
  and pulling her hand away had taken a small effort of will.
At least nobody had noticed, or she didn't think anyone had.

Angela pulled out her notebook and opened up,
  just letting her pen wander.

Jess _had_ been sympathetic,
  talking things through with Angela to help her sort out her thoughts, but ...

What _had_ Angela expected, exactly?

More information &mdash; details on security patrols, 
  help and advice on refining and developing the fragment Angela had laid out?

A promise to help her escape &mdash; from what even?

That they'd a freedom pact like _Thamhad_ and _Sannair_, like in the stories?

The idea of "forging a freedom pact" over _text_ of all things felt ... almost sacrilegious somehow,
  and humans didn't really even _have_ stories like that.
Sure, _The Italian Job_, _Ocean's 11_, or _Logan Lucky_, had similar plots,
  but there weren't any of the themes of the sort found in something like _One Piece_ or other Sh≈çnen.

Besides, the real world doesn't work that way.
This wasn't a fairy tale, this was real life.

And besides, at the intellectual level Angela didn't even _want_ to "escape".
Yes, escape the _planet_, but that was the _whole point_ of staying focused,
  working on the project, and upholding her end of the deal.

And if she did want to leave, walk out on the project, she could.
That had been part of the deal.

If she really wanted out, she didn't _need_ to "escape" or do anything dramatic.
The humans _would_ honor their agreement.
Right?

Angela read the last text from Jess again.

> `Just try to hold out until you get back to Palmdale, we'll figure something out.`

Maybe "we'll figure something out" was meant as some kind of promise,
  but the vagueness didn't help.

Who was "we"? Herself and Jess? Herself, Jess, and some additional accomplice?

She trusted Jess, but did she trust everyone _Jess_ trusted?

Did this "we" include one of _them_ &mdash; whoever it is _they_ were?

Stop.

No.

This sort of eisegesis was the opposite helpful.

There was no conspiracy,
  there was nobody after her,
  the entire concept was as far-fetched today as it was day _one_,
  and she couldn't start doubting _everyone_ and _everything_ over some _slightly vague wording_ in a _text message_.

When she got to LAX, Angela wasn't going to _do_ anything.

She was going to step off the plane,
  walk down the concourse to the curb,
  and then ride in the car back to Palmdale.

Once she was there, _then_ she could worry about this.

Angela came to a halt,
  realizing to her horror that she'd been mumbling some of these thoughts out loud.

She shot her gaze around,
  ears wiggling under her hood,
  and immediately felt like she was being watched again.

How much had she said?
Had anyone heard?

It didn't look like anyone had noticed,
  and with din of the crowd starting to line up to board the plane,
  it would've been difficult for anyone further than a few feet to hear.

It's fine.

Don't stress.

Angela looked down at her notepad.

She'd unconsciously drawn out a map of LAX terminal six,
  plotting the route she expected to take out of the airport.
And it was covered with annotations,
  various half-baked "escape" plans scribbled on and around it.

Ugh! No!

At least most of this was written in her native Kemhe script,
  although there were a few English words scattered in there.
It's not like anyone except maybe a few of the linguists could actually read this, right?

Besides,
  she'd still need some kind of diversion or some way to create extra chaos
  for the plan to have even a chance of working.

She forced her mind back off that track,
  and found she'd written that thought down at the bottom of the page.
In English.

"Aagh! No!"

She tore the page from her notebook and ripped it in half, and jumped to her feet.

She suddenly felt very conscious of the attention this outburst had attracted from the gathering line of people,
  and she froze, frantically searching for a way out.

"Time to go."
The words from her bodyguard brought Angela back to ground.

Stop.

Breathe.

It was time for her to board the plane.

The wadded paper made a *shnk* sound against the plastic liner of the trash can
  as Angela fled down the jet bridge.

--------

"con-spur *nnn* they're after me *nnn* won't work *nnn* need to trust", Angela mumbled quietly.

It had taken Solomon a few minutes to get through security,
  re-acquire his target, and set up,
  but this was definitely her.
  
Solomon had set up just out of line of sight, on the other side and a bit further down,
  and now listened carefully to try to pick out anything he could.

Optical microphones of the sort he'd pointed at the plate glass window in front Angela were often unreliable,
  but it was about the only thing with any hope of isolating conversation in this environment, at this range.

So far, his effort had been thwarted, but finally he'd managed to pick up something.

Solomon recorded everything, and made careful note of it all.

The thug following her wasn't doing anything to try to blend in,
  leaning against a pillar in open view.
He hadn't been able to find any matches for him so far,
  so Solomon didn't have much to go on in terms of potential actors,
  but he could hazard a guess as to why the man was here.

In other circumstances he would've guessed "bodyguard",
  but given the way Angela had tried to ditch him at the security checkpoint that seemed very unlikely.

Clearly whoever it was didn't care if she noticed him,
  and based on body language and her fragmented mumblings just now,
  she clearly _had_ noticed, and considered him a threat.

He was here to intimidate her and ensure she got on the plane.
  
Why this mystery actor felt the need to force her onto a plane &mdash;
  rather than, say, simply kidnapping her &mdash;
  was still a mystery.
  
Solomon had had to employ similar tactics himself in the past,
  usually force nosy journalists who were getting too close out of the country,
  _before_ they'd put themselves in _real_ danger asking the wrong questions.

Another group of people passed by,
  blocking the beam from his mic and cutting off the audio.

Solomon's plane was due to begin boarding in only half an hour,
  but he didn't care.
There were at least six other flights he could catch to JFK and still make the overnight to Cairo,
  and this was far more important than what he'd be doing in New York.

After a moment the crowd subsided and he was able to re-acquire the signal.

"&mdash; step off the plane," there was a brief pause, "then worry about this".
Angela was silent after this.

Solomon waited, listened, and watched.

After a moment there was a brief outburst,
  and Solomon turned to look;
  his gaze would be only of several, and wouldn't be out of place.

Angela had stepped into Solomon's line of sight from behind the pillar,
  and tore a sheet of paper in half,
  but then froze as the thug walked up to her.

After making some sort of remark Solomon couldn't hear &mdash; likely a warning not to cause any trouble &mdash;
  he escorted her up to the gate, and followed her down the jet bridge.

A second later, Solomon realized that Angela had thrown the scrap of paper into a trash when she'd passed by.

Solomon waited as the remaining passengers boarded, and the plane pushed away from the gate.

The thug did not re-emerge; he'd boarded the plane with her.
Unusual, but probably meant there was a specific connecting flight they needed to force her to take.
It also meant that this actor probably didn't intend to shoot down the plane or otherwise have it crash.

He sat there for another half hour,
  following the flight's progress as it taxied to the runway and took off,
  watching and waiting to ensure any _other_ potential observers had had the opportunity to move on.

Hers was an eight-hour flight from DCA to LAX.
Solomon had plenty of time to wait, plan, and figure out the correct course of action.
What he didn't have time for were sloppy mistakes.

But the first step would be retrieving the paper Angela had thrown into the trash.

Solomon winced as a kid threw a McDonalds bag smeared with ketchup into the same trash bin.
The kid missed and it bounced off the rim onto the floor, but he'd waited long enough.

He packed everything back into his bag, and got to work.

First, a bag of chips from the mall kiosk.
He paid for it with cash.

In the bathroom, he changed into the horrifically garish Hawaiian shirt and hideous pair of shutter shades.
He had planned to wear these getting off in Cairo.

He opened the bag of chips, and emptied most of the chips into the toilet.

He stepped out of the restroom, and sauntered back down the terminal.

He paused in the walkway, a few feet from the trash can.

He looked into the bag, and shook it slightly to emphasize it's near-emptiness to any potential observers.

From here, he could see the two wadded pieces of paper,
  resting near the top of the can atop other garbage.

He took the last potato chip, and ate it.

He didn't have to feign disgust at the ketchup splattered around the can's rim, but it was a useful excuse.
He lowered the empty bag into the can gingerly, by one corner.

When he withdrew his hand, both halves of the page were crumpled tightly into one palm.

He didn't look at either of them. Not yet.

He returned to the walkway, and resumed walking, until he was far out of sight at the other end of the terminal.

--------

At this point, there was very little Solomon could have done from DC that he couldn't do from New York,
  but his heart was still pounding when he boarded the flight to JFK.

_This is why I was never a field agent,_ he grumbled to himself.
Solomon was perfectly capable of doing field work himself,
  but had never been his area of expertise,
  and he now felt a bit silly about the elaborate stunt he'd pulled to grab the paper from the trash.

_I'll take a potato chip, and **eat it**_ indeed. Ugh.

After paying the extortion rates most airlines in the US _still_ charged for WiFi,
  he was able to photograph the two halves of the paper and upload them to his intelligence aggregator for processing.

Matching the seam between the two fragments together wasn't difficult,
  and he submitted a search query for anything and everything relevant to the contents that the servers could find.

The writing on the page was _exceptionally_ neat,
  not quite typewritten but very evenly-spaced in uniform straight rows.

The text itself though drifted between English and some other script Solomon didn't immediately recognise.

It looked a bit familiar though, and ... he stared at it for a few moments.
_Oh. That would make a lot of sense._

He pulled up his scans of the Auriga flight manuals. This was definitely a match.

And further confirmation.
Angela wasn't just someone _else_ who matched the profile and had somehow gotten deeply involved with all this by mistake.
Angela _was_ the alien.

Of Solomon's team, Joyce knew the most about this script, and he immediately sent her a message containing the scans.
He'd have to wait until the plane landed to make a live call,
  but she would need some time to look at it anyway.

Most of the mixed english and xeno text was scattered across some kind of diagram or map,
  presumptively annotations of some kind for it.
He didn't recognise it,
  but when the aggregation servers returned a hit for LAX terminal six,
  he wasn't surprised.

What was surprising was how _accurate_ the drawn map was.
The outline of the terminal was a near perfect match.

_Is this even drawn, rather than printed?_
Solomon re-inspected the paper, and felt the marks on the page.
It looked like pen ink,
  and there were small impressions in the page from a pen being dragged across the surface,
  right where one would expect.

There were also _other_ impressions,
  from whatever had been written on the _previous_ page.

He needed to get this developed, ASAP.

--------

Solomon again sat at a cafe in an airport, this time in New York.
Instead of meeting with his associate as he'd planned,
  he'd spent the majority of the day analyzing the document,
  comparing it to other evidence,
  and trying to piece everything together.

Finding a forensic document examiner in New York
  willing to work on such short notice had taken several hours,
  and cost him a pretty penny.

It also hadn't given him much more to go on,
  aside from a confirmation that this was indeed handwritten rather than drawn with a pen plotter.

Most of the latent indented handwriting had just turned out to be some kind of decorative geometric design.
The pattern _did_ bear some faint resemblance to some of the written glyphs.
  but nobody had any sense for what it was or meant,
  and they couldn't simply turn to the internet here like they'd been able to with the flight manual.
Jack had said it looked vaguely reminiscent of a complicated distributed element filter.

They had, however, been able to discern some meaning from the visible writing.
The smattering of English words had revealed several interesting faucets of the language's sentence structure,
  and Joyce had been able to provide rough meanings for many of the annotations.

Solomon went over what he'd been able to determine one more time,
  hoping something else might pop out at him.

Fact 1.
Whichever actor had sent the thug to ensure Angela got on the plane,
  Angela had apparently been aware of them for a significant length of time,
  likely back to or possibly before the train fire and mugging incidents four months ago.

Fact 2, she'd known in advance, that this actor would be sending someone to escort or follow her,
  and she had planned to escape from them at Los Angeles airport.

Fact 3, there was some other co-conspirator that she'd expected to provide some kind of assistance in her escape,
  but this had failed in some way,
  and she'd been forced to plan around it.

Fact 4, the plan she'd laid out had a _very_ low chance of working.

Angela had marked out on her map,
  dozens of different chokepoints, alternate routes, and possible diversions relevant to the escape route.
All things considered, it wasn't a bad plan.

For an amateur, anyway.
She'd missed one _critical_ point along the route she'd marked.

Nearly thirty years ago, Solomon had been involved in an operation trying to retrieve a target that had fled to the US,
  that had involved a very similar sort of "escort" mission through Los Angeles International Airport.
It was one of the very few overseas operations he'd conducted in the US,
  and it wasn't one he was proud of, but he'd done what he had to.

Fortunately the efforts to divert the plane to a more favorable terminal had worked,
  and consequently the terminal six plan hadn't been necessary.
But assuming the currently ongoing operation was being coordinated by anyone even remotely competent,
  Solomon was almost _certain_ there'd be a second thug waiting to intervene at that critical junction.

Angela had, fortunately, seem to realize there was _something_ wrong with the plan,
  even if she hadn't realized why.
Down at the very bottom, she'd written in English,
  "still need a diversion", "escape in the chaos".
Although brief, those notions were _exactly_ correct,
  and with the right sort of diversion the plan _could_ still work.

The means to create such a diversion were easily within Solomon's grasp.

Solomon didn't know the full situation.
He'd done his best to find out as much as he could,
  but he still hadn't been able to dig up who this mystery actor was,
  what they wanted with Angela.

For that matter, Solomon didn't know _why_ Angela was here, on this planet.
The best conjecture he could figure is that the "original" Auriga pod he had in Cairo was an _escape_ pod,
  and she'd landed here due to some emergency or fault with the Carina mothership and was now stranded.

What was Solomon's _goal_ here, exactly?
Why did he care?
What was he hoping to accomplish?

Certainly, if Solomon did nothing this mystery actor was going to achieve _their_ goal,
  and any action he took would be adversarial to them.
_Should_ he oppose them, not knowing anything about what their goals even were?

Perhaps she posed some kind of real danger, that this mystery actor hoped to avert.
Solomon himself had certainly made the choice himself many times in his career,
  putting what was necessary over what felt right or just or fair.

That was the key question: Did Angela pose a threat?
To Earth, to its people, to anyone.

Even if it was known for certain that Angela didn't pose a threat,
  any intelligence agency worth their salt aware of her would still try to persue her
If this actor was from outside the US, it would make sense that they'd want to 
  strong-arm her onto friendly territory before taking custody.

The current operation didn't prove anything either way in that regard,
  except that they'd noticed her.
Really, given that she'd first arrived nearly two years ago and it had taken until just four months ago _for_ anyone to notice,
  indicated the opposite: she _didn't_ pose a significant threat.

So then, was interfering the right thing to do?

What were Solomon's _own_ interests in the matter?
Gaining access to Angela himself would be invaluable for the project,
  and that was far more likely to be possible if Angela escaped.

Angela almost certainly knew more about this actor's intentions than he did,
  and she'd judged it worthwhile to plan to escape.
Either way, if she were captured that would likely be final.

Angela's plane had just started it's approach to land,
  and if he was going to act, he needed to set things into motion well before it got to the gate.
The deadline was four minutes from now.

By intervening,
  he might do more harm than good.

It was dangerous to depend on her ability to think on her feet,
  and if something fell flat in the execution because she wasn't expecting the diversion to occur,
  she might be injured or killed in the attempt.

Was that risk worse than the risk posed by doing nothing?
When you weren't sure, doing nothing was often the safer policy.

It's possible Solomon had made an assumption somewhere along the line,
  and his understanding of the situation could be totally skewed.
If he'd just been more diligent in his investigation,
  less concerned about his own safety,
  _something_,
  maybe he'd have found some bit of information that would've changed the whole picture.

But one rarely knew all of the facts.
If you thought you did, you were probably more ignorant than anyone.
And if you waited until you were certain, it was almost always too late.

Solomon reviewed [the checklist][checklist] he'd filled out one last time, and made his decision.
