Solomon sat in a cafe on the upper deck of the airport terminal,
  idly watching the crowd below file through security as he ate.
Lines were short this morning, and his flight wasn't until nine,
  but for the moment he had nowhere better to be,
  and not enough time to do anything more.

In any case, watching crowds could be fun,
  especially giving tongue-in-cheek nicknames to anyone who stood out.

At the moment Oscar the Grouch towed his girlfriend behind him,
  irritated that he couldn't feel irritated about the length of the line.

Karen from Accounting _didn't_ end up speaking with the checkpoint guard's manager,
  but she made it clear she had a Very Important Appointment waiting for her on the other side.

And Jabba the Hutt trailed a line of squealing jawas behind her,
  while Han Solo trailed behind,
  looking like he'd rather still be frozen in carbonite.

The slice of toast gave a satisfying *crunch* as Solomon bit into it,
  the sweetness of the jam combining with the caramelized flavors of the toasted bread,
  complimenting the cheap but not unpleasant flavor of the coffee in the cup next to it.

Solomon reviewed his plans on his laptop,
  navigating through different pieces of information in his virtual crazy wall software,
  updating it with information from emails he'd received last night.
  
A letter from a middle manager in one of the launch partners indicating &mdash; in far too many words &mdash;
  that something-or-other relating to labor practices had general support and would be able to go to a vote.

Another indicated that the proposed revisions to the aerospace aluminum tariff schedule had gone through,
  securing Solomon's end of a bargain with another supplier.

It wasn't all good news, unfortunately.
The project review board's report had included an extra finding he'd hoped they'd omit,
  and while he already had a scapegoat lined up, that was going to cost him a few favors.

Just more byzantine corporate politics.

Down below, Sideways Baseball Hat made a lewd comment at one of the security guards as he waddled past in his saggy pants,
  and earned himself a free secondary screening and an escort over to one side.

Green Hoodie glanced around as a guard opened her bag for a search.
For a moment Solomon thought she'd might've just reached in and palmed something,
  but it could have just as easily been a trick of the light.

Pee-Wee Harris had forgotten to to put his knife in his checked bag with the rest of his troop,
  and one of the older scouts took him back to help him Fed-Ex it home.

Arnold Schwarzenegger presented some kind of badge as he pulled a holster out of jacket,
  placing it and the gun it contained on the conveyor belt.

Overall, it looked like Solomon's political maneuverings were about to pay off.
There was still a chance he'd be saddled with an administrator if his business in New York didn't pan out,
  but even if so he was pretty confident he knew who they'd saddle him with.
  he might not like it but he could at least work with them.

The waitress came by to refill his coffee,
  and Solomon was mid-sentence asking for another plate of toast
  when something suddenly snagged in the back of his mind.

He froze, and quickly looked back down over the edge of the balcony.

For some reason Schwarzenegger had been held up,
  and the guard had called over a superior to verify the document or badge he'd presented.
He was clearly becoming very agitated,
  trying to pay attention to something on the other side of the checkpoint,
  while simultaneously having to pay attention to the guards to resolve the holdup.

Solomon followed his gaze just in time to see Green Hoodie disappear into the crowd,
  getting a glimpse of her face as she glanced back towards the checkpoint.

And there it was.

Solomon realized he'd stopped mid-sentence,
  and he apologized to the waitress as he scrambled to pull up a picture.
"Sorry, give me a minute."

The one photo he'd managed to find that showed a face wasn't great,
  and he really hadn't gotten that good of a glance,
  but in many of the others she wore a _very_ similar green hoodie,
  and the build was _definitely_ a match.

--------

The feeling of being watched subsided as Angela got away from the checkpoint,
  and after a moment her bodyguard caught up, puffing only slightly from the effort.

It had been a stroke of luck when he'd been held up,
  giving her the perfect chance to retrieve one of the items from her bag without him breathing down her neck.
She certainly hadn't been going to wait for him,
  and it would've been all the better if he'd somehow managed to lose her all on his own.

After a night's rest she was a lot more composed than she'd been the night before,
  but the nagging need to get away somehow was still very much present,
  and the lockpicks and notebook in her bag weighed heavily on her mind.

She didn't like to rely on magic &mdash;
  not after her failure under pressure with defending herself that in a way had led to _all of this_ &mdash;
  but she now had a lot more practice with the handful of spells the humans had had her repeatedly cast for their experiments.

She also spent some time to prepare several nearly-complete sigils in her notebook.
Preparing partial incomplete spells were a bit tricky,
  because if you waited too long you'd forget where you were,
  and you had to spend the time up front to do everything in a way that would make it easy to pick back up.
As long as you had at least a vague memory of what you were doing it wasn't too difficult,
  and could be a significant time saver if you needed to be able to cast a more complex spell quickly.

Back on Kemhe, carrying a notebook with some of the spells she'd drawn could get one in a _lot_ of trouble,
  but here on Earth there were only a handful of people that would even know what they were,
  much less try to stop her.

After a moment Angela got to the gate,
  and took a seat to wait for the flight.

Last night after reaching the breaking point,
  Angela had finally bucked down and texted Jess
  pouring out everything that had been going on.

Her escalationg stress from working in the same few locations.
Echoes of her feelings of vulnerability after having been assaulted four months ago.
How her need for security had twisted into a paranoid fear of the bodyguards assigned to her.

The loss of control, her efforts to manage her stress, ideations about escaping and running away.
Even going so far as to lay out fragments of a plan,
  details she'd noticed about how to get past the security fence in Palmdale.
The map she'd put together of traffic around NIH,
  showing all the back entrances and broom closets and mechanical spaces of the main building where she usually worked.
Everything.

To what end she didn't know,
  but at that point she'd just been texting everything she could think of,
  hoping Jess would be able to help her.

Of all the humans she knew, Jess was probably the one she trusted most.
She'd been consistently sympathetic in the past,
  and was generally fairly outspoken in advocating for her interests,
  at least in the few meetings she went too.

Unfortunately, while Mike and Matt had both managed to find their niche within the project working with different teams,
  Jess hadn't really found a place where she could really do much,
  and had announced that she'd be returning back to school to finish her mechanical engineering degree next fall.

This had been a bit of a blow to Angela, but this was her decision;
  even if Angela _could_ convince her to stay, if Jess felt the need to move on it wouldn't be right to.
This was one of the main reasons she'd held off asking for help for so long,
  and Angela still felt bad about getting her involved in what was really a personal issue.

Well, she hadn't told her _everything_.
She glanced behind her, to where her bodyguard stood a respectful distance away against a large pillar.

Going through security had been nerve-wracking,
  and while none of the items in her bag were strictly speaking against _their_ rules,
  it had been especially embarrassing when her bag had been searched.

She'd almost instinctively reached out to try to snag something from it when it had been opened,
  and pulling her hand away had taken a small effort of will.
At least nobody had noticed, or she didn't think anyone had.

Angela pulled out her notebook and opened up,
  just letting her pen wander.

Jess had been sympathetic,
  talking things through with Angela to help her sort out her thoughts, but ...

What _had_ she expected, exactly?

More information &mdash; details on security patrols, 
  help and advice on refining and developing the fragment Angela had laid out?
  
A promise to help her escape? From what even?

That they'd a freedom pact like _Thamhad_ and _Sannair_, like in the stories?

The idea of "forging a freedom pact" over _text_ of all things felt ... almost sacriligious somehow,
  and humans didn't really even _have_ stories like that.
Sure, _The Italian Job_, _Ocean's 11_, or _Logan Lucky_, had similar plots,
  but there weren't any of the themes of the sort found in something like _One Piece_ or other Shōnen.

Besides, the real world doesn't work that way.
This wasn't a fairy tail, this was real life.

And besides, at the intellectual level Angela didn't even _want_ to "escape".
Yes, escape the _planet_, but that was the _whole point_ of staying focused,
  working on the project, and upholding her end of the deal.

Angela read the last text from Jess again.

> `Just try to hold out until you get back to Palmdale, we'll figure something out.`

Maybe "we'll figure something out" was meant as some kind of promise,
  but the vagueness didn't help.

Who was "we"? Herself and Jess? Herself, Jess, and some additional "help"?

She trusted Jess, but did she trust everyone _Jess_ trusted?

Did this "we" include one of _them_ &mdash; whoever it is _they_ were?

Stop.

Focus.

No. This sort of eisegesis was the opposite helpful.

There was no conspiracy,
  there was nobody after her,
  the entire concept was as far-fetched today as it was day _one_,
  and she couldn't start doubting _everyone_ and _everything_ over some _slightly vague wording_ in a _text message_.

When she got to LAX, Angela wasn't going to _do_ anything.

She was going to step off the plane,
  walk down the concourse to the curb,
  and then ride in the car back to Palmdale.

Once she was there, _then_ she could worry about this.

Angela came to a halt,
  realizing to her horror that she'd been mumbling some of her thoughts out loud.

She shot her gaze around.
How much had she said?
Had anyone heard her?

It didn't look like anyone had noticed,
  and the din of the crowd meant it would've been difficult for anyone to hear.
But the feeling of being watched had just returned in full force.

The plane had just started boarding, and she looked down at her notepad.
She'd unconciously drawn out a rough map of LAX terminal 6,
  marking the route she expected to taking out of the airport.

Worse still, she'd made annotations for various half-baked "escape" plans on it.

Ugh!

At least most of it was written in her native Kemhe script rather than English,
  although there were a few English words scattered in there,
  mostly for terms like "electricity" or "internet" that didn't have any equivalent.

Besides,
  she'd still need some kind of diversion or some way to create extra chaos
  for any of it to have even a chance of working.

She forced her mind back from that track,
  and found she'd written that thought down at the bottom of the page, in English.

"Aagh! No!" She tore the page from her notebook and ripped it in half, jumping to her feet.
She crumpled it up and stalked over to the trash before agressively throwing the crumpled page in,
  making a *shnk* noise against the plastic liner.

It was time for her to board anyway.

--------

"con-spur *nnn* they're after me *nnn* won't work *nnn* need to trust", Angela mumbled quietly.

It had taken him only a few minutes to get through security,
  re-aquire his target, and set up,
  but this was definitely her.
  
Solomon had set up just out of line of site, on the other side and a bit further down,
  and was listened carefully to try to pick out anything he could.

Optical microphones of the sort he'd pointed at the plate glass window in front Angela were often unreliable,
  but it was about the only thing with any hope of isolating any sort conversation in this kind of environment.

So far, his effort had been thwarted, but finally he managed to pick up something.

He was recorded everything, and made careful note of everything he heard.

The thug following her wasn't doing anything to try to blend in,
  leaning against a pillar in open view.
He hadn't been able to find any matches for him so far,
  so Solomon didn't have much to go on in terms of potential actors,
  but he could hazard a guess as to why the man was here.

In other circumstances he would've guessed "bodyguard",
  but given the way Angela had tried to ditch him at the security checkpoint that seemed very unlikely.

Clearly whoever it was didn't care if she noticed him,
  and based on her body language and the fragmented mumblings just now,
  she clearly had, and considered him a threat.

He was here to intimidate her and ensure she got on the plane.
  
Why this mystery actor felt the need to force her onto a plane &mdash;
  rather than, say, simply kidnapping her &mdash;
  was still a mystery.
  
Solomon had had to employ similar tactics himself in the past,
  to force nosy journalists who were getting too close out of the country,
  ideally _before_ they'd put themselves in _real_ danger asking the wrong questions.

Another group of people passed by,
  blocking the beam from his mic and cutting off the audio.

Solomon's plane was due to begin boarding in only half an hour,
  but he didn't care.
There were at least six other flights he could catch to JFK and still make the overnight to Cairo,
  and this was far more important than what he'd be doing in New York.

After a moment the crowd subsided and he was able to re-aquire the signal.

"Step off the plane," there was a brief pause, "then worry about this."
She was silent after this.

Solomon waited, listened, and watched.

After a moment there was a brief cry of frustration, and Solomon glanced over.
Angela strode into his sight line from behind the pillar, tearing a sheet of paaper in half and balling it up.

She tossed it into the trash, and boarded the plane.
The thug followed her on.

Unusual, but probably meant there was a specific connecting flight they were going to force her to take.
It also meant that this actor probably didn't intend to shoot down the plane or otherwise have it crash.

Solomon waited until the plane had pulled away from the gate.
He looked up the flight number based on the gate, and followed its progress as it moved to the runway and took off.

He sat there for another half hour,
  watching and waiting to ensure any _other_ potential observers had had the opportinuty to move on.

Hers was an eight-hour flight from DCA to LAX.
Solomon had plenty of time to wait, plan, and figure out the correct course of action.
What he didn't have time for were sloppy mistakes.

But the first step would be retrieving whatever it was Angela had thrown in the trash.

Solomon winced as a kid threw a McDonalds bag smeared with ketchup into the trash bin.
The kid missed and it bounced off the rim onto the floor, but that was enough.

He packed everything back into his bag, and got to work.

First, a bag of chips from the mall kiosk.
He paid for it with cash.

In the bathroom, he changed into the horrificly garish Hawaiian shirt and hideous pair of shutter shades.
He had planned to wear these getting off in Cairo.

He opened the bag of chips, and emptied most of the chips into the toilet.

He stepped out of the restroom, and sauntered back down the terminal.

He paused in the walkway, a few feet from the trash can.

He looked into the bag, and shook it slightly to emphasize it's near-emptiness to any potential observers.

From here, he could see the two wadded pieces of paper,
  resting near the top of the can atop other garbage.

He took the last potato chip, and ate it.

He didn't have to feign disgust at the ketchup splattered around the can's rim, but it was a useful excuse.
He lowered the empty bag into the can gingerly, by one corner.

When he withdrew his hand, both halves of the page were crumpled tightly into one palm.

He didn't look at either of them.

He returned to the walkway, and resumed walking, until he was far out of sight at the other end of the terminal.

--------

At this point, there was very little Solomon could have done from DC that he couldn't do from New York,
  and he took the next flight to JFK while he waited for his heart to stop pounding.

_This is why I was never a field agent,_ he grumbled to himself.
Solomon was perfectly capable of doing field work himself,
  but had never been his area of expertise,
  and he now felt a bit silly about the elaborate stunt he'd pulled to grab the halves of the page.

_I'll take a potato chip, and **eat it** indeed._ Ugh.

After paying the extortion rates most American airlines _still_ charged for WiFi,
  he was able to photograph the two halves of the paper and upload them to his intelligence aggregator for processing.

From that point, matching the seam between the two fragments together wasn't difficult,
  and he submitted a search for anything and everything relevant the servers could find.

The writing on the page was _exceptionally_ neat,
  not quite typewritten but very evenly-spaced in uniform straight rows.

The text itself though drifted between English and some other script Solomon didn't immediately recognise.

It looked a bit familiar though, and ... he stared at it for a few moments.
_Oh. That would make a lot of sense._

He pulled up the Auriga flight manuals. This was definitely a match.

And further confirmation.
This Angela wasn't just someone else who'd somehow gotten deeply involved with whatever was going on.
She _was_ the alien.

Of Solomon's team, Joyce knew the most about this script, and he immediately send her a message containing the scans.
He'd have to wait until the plane landed to make a live call,
  but she would need some time to look at it anyway.

Most of the mixed english and xeno text was scattered across some kind of diagram or map,
  presumptively annotations of some kind for it.
He didn't recognise it,
  but when the aggregation servers returned a hit for LAX terminal six,
  he wasn't suprised.

What was suprising was how _accurate_ the drawn map was.
The outline of the terminal was a near perfect match.

_Were the map outlines even drawn, rather than printed?_
Solomon re-inspected the paper, and felt the marks on the page.
The ink was a visual matche,
  and there were small impressions in the page from a pen being dragged across the surface,
  right where one would expect.

There were also _other_ impressions,
  from whatever had been written on the _previous_ page.
He needed to get this developed, ASAP.

--------

Solomon again sat at a cafe in an airport, this time in New York.
Instead of meeting with his associate as he'd planned,
  he'd spent the majority of the day analyzing the document,
  comparing it to his other evidence, and trying to piece everything together.

It had taken him several hours to find a private forensic document examiner
  who could examine the document in the time he had left.
  
The latent indented handwriting had turned out to just be some kind of decorative geometric design,
  which Jack said was vaguely reminiscent of a complicated distributed element filter.

The pattern _did_ bear a slight resemblence to some of the written glyphs,
  but nobody had any sense for what it was or meant,
  and they couldn't simply turn to the internet here like they'd been able to with the flight manual.

They had, however, been able to discern some meaning from the visible writing.
The smattering of English words had revealed several interesting faucets of the language's sentence structure,
  and Joyce had been able to provide rough meanings for many of the annotations.

Fact 1.
Whichever actor had sent the thug to ensure Angela got on the plane,
  Angela had apparently been aware of them for a significant length of time,
  likely back to or possibly before the train fire and mugging incidents four months ago.

Fact 2, she'd known in advance, that this actor would be sending someone &mdash;
  in their idiom, a "strong person" &mdash;
  to accompany/escort/follow her,
  and had planned to escape from them at Los Angeles airport.

Fact 3, there was some other co-consirator that she'd expected to provide some kind of assistance in her escape,
  but this had failed in some way,
  and she'd been forced to plan around it.

Fact 4, the plan she'd laid out had a _very_ low chance of working.

Angela had marked out on her map,
  dozens of different chokepoints, alternate routes, and possible diversions relevant to her main path of escape.
All things considered it wan't a horrible plan for an amateur,
  but there _was_ one critical spot she'd missed in her planning.

Solomon was almost _certain_ there'd be a second thug waiting there to intervene.
Or, depending on this mystery actor's disposition, a sniper.

Solomon knew this because he'd positioned one of his own agents at exactly that spot himself,
  nearly thirty years ago.

It was one of the very few overseas operations he'd conducted in the US,
  and it wasn't one he was proud of, but he'd done what he had to.
In his case it had fortunately ended up being unnecessary,
  but if Angela tried to escape that way, she might not even survive.

Angela had, fortunately, seem to realize there was _something_ wrong with the plan,
  even if she hadn't realized why.
Down at the very bottom, she'd written in English,
  "still need a diversion", "escape in the chaos",
  and although brief, those notions were _exactly_ correct,
  and with the right sort of diversion the plan _could_ still work.

And the means to create such a diversion were easily within Solomon's grasp.

He didn't know her full situation;
  he'd done his best to find out as much as he could,
  but he still hadn't been able to find who this mystery actor was,
  or what they wanted with Angela.

It's possible he'd made an assumption somewhere along the line,
  and his understanding of the situation could be totally skewed.
If he'd just been more diligent in his investigation,
  less concerned about his own safety,
  _something_,
  maybe he'd have found some bit of information that could've changed the whole picture.

By intervening,
  he might do more harm than good,
  if she somehow find a better plan,
  if she had some unknown capability that would've allowed the original plan to work,
  or if something else fell flat in the execution.

But one rarely knew all of the facts.
If you thought you did, you were probably more ignorant of the truth than anyone,
  and if you waited until you were certain,
  it would already be too late.

If Solomon was going to act, the deadline was four minutes from now.

Angela's plane had just started it's approach to land, and if he was going to act,
  he needed to act well before it got to the gate.

Solomon reviewed [the checklist][checklist] he'd filled out one last time, and dialed a number on his phone.
