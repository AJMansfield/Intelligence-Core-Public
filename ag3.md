Angela had been in Salt Lake City for four weeks so far.
She knew the colony would be forming in this city, but for reasons she couldn't even begin to fathom, she'd started feeling the instinctual pull only in very short bursts, making the exact location very hard to track down.
The fact she had been living on the street for the last week of that hadn't helped matters, and her bag containing her medical supplies had been stolen, although for some reason the thief had left the rest of her stuff alone.

But she'd finally narrowed the location down, and now that she was close by she could easily tell where to go.

Matt was sitting at his computer when there was a knock at the door.
He was expecting a package containing the first samples of the silicon dies etched with the pufferfish pattern, so he quickly got up and answered.

When he opened the door though, instead of the delivery driver he was met by a child wearing a green hoodie, and going by height looked to be about 11 or 12.

"Who are you?" Matt hadn't been expecting anyone, and it was doubly unusual for a child to be here in the office building.

"I'm Angela"

"That ... didn't really answer my question. Where are your parents?"

She stepped past him into the office. "Rude. Where are the others?"

Matt was confused. "What others?"

She turned back to face him and pulled back her hood to reveal a pair of pointed ears. She must have been wearing some kind of prosthetic makeup.

"You know..." she said, and wiggled the ears at him, "the others?"

Very expensive prosthetic makeup.

Angela turned and walked further into the office, before entering Matt's cubicle and sitting down in his chair.

Jessica appeared from around the corner.
"What is going on here? You can't be back here this is private property."

"Where is it?" Angela asked, sounding slightly annoyed.

"Where is what? And get out of my chair."

Angela didn't move. "The colony sigil."

"What" Matt paused "are you talking about?"

As if to answer, Angela grabbed a sheet of paper from the desk and quickly drew something on it.
"This thing?" she indicated, holding it up.

"The pufferfish pattern?"
Matt had no idea what was going on here.

Now it was Angela's turn to be confused.
"The what?"

"Ok, let's start over from the beginning.
Who are you, and why are you here?" Matt began.

Mike had joined them and they'd moved to a larger table.

"My name is Angela. I am a Phascolian from alpha WISE 0720-0846 b."
She'd looked up the Human's official name for her birth star a few weeks ago out of curiosity, and was now glad she had.

"Okay ... "
Jessica arched her eyebrow at Matt, who shrugged back.
"And why are you here?"

"I'm here to form a colony on this planet."

Mike shot back. 
"Cut the crap, nobody believes you're a space alien.
What are you doing _here_, in _this building_?"

Anglea was indignant.
"I told you.
I'm here to meet up with the others of my kind and form a colony.
And I am _not_ an _alien_!"
One of the first things she'd done after arriving was to apply for citizenship.

If Jessica could've rolled her eyes any harder, they'd have popped right out of her head.
"This is getting us nowhere.
What were you doing with this?"
She indicated the sheet of paper Angela had drawn the colony sigil on.

"What do you mean what was I doing with this, that's how I knew to come here!"
Angela was nearly shouting.
"What are you doing with this!?"
Angela snatched up one of the printouts containing the colony sigil.

There were marks for _tens of thousands_ of individuals on the sigil, and these Humans had made literally _dozens_ of _active copies_!
Never mind the danger of being so careless with active sigils, the mere _idea_ of a colony with "just" a thousand members was distasteful, and these were downright obscene.

There was a doorbell chime, and Matt walked over to the door.
A man wearing a FedEx uniform was waiting at the door with a large padded envelope, and Matt signed for the delivery.
Angela started getting a creeping feeling of dread about the contents of this package as Matt carried it over to his desk.
He ripped the envelope off, to reveal a flat plastic tray filled with tiny metallic squares.

"Die samples are here."

"Please, don't open that." Angela said softly, as Matt cut the tape seals holding the tray's lid on.

She stood up and shouted. "Please, don't open that!"
But it was too late, and Matt had already popped the lid off.

The last thing Angela knew, she had vomited all over the floor and promptly passed out.
