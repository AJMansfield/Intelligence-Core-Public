# Worldbuilding a Fictional Legal System

> Alice and Bob each own plots of land adjacent to each other.
> For whatever reason, some bit of Alice's land adjacent to Bob's plot falls into disuse, and isn't regularly inspected by Alice.
> Bob then plows and plants a field that crosses just over the boundary, so that 1/10th of the field's total area is on Alice's property.
> He then grows and harvests 10 tons of corn in that field.
> 
> Alice then discovers the violation and sues for relief.
> How would Alice proceed, and what and how much is Alice entitled to collect from Bob in this situation?

## Settlement

In most systems, an issue like this can usually be resolved directly between them, if both consent.
> Alice: "Hey Bob, your field crosses the property line, you owe me."
and under most circumstances
> Oh hey, my bad, I guess I owe you some of the harvest from that section of land.
Alice accepts, and that's the end of it.
