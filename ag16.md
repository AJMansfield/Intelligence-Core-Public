**Tenleytown-AU Metro Station**  
*Washington DC*

Angela picked herself back up off the pavement where she'd fallen
  as the train pulled out of the station,
  and tried to gather the contents of her bag from where they had spilled.

She'd started feeling this odd sense of danger part way through the ride.
There hadn't been anything actually _wrong_ that she'd been able to tell looking around,
  and she'd just ignored at first,
  but the feeling had gotten stronger as the metro train continued along its route,
  up until she'd made the split-second decision to get off here.
She still had no idea why she'd felt as if she were in danger,
  but instincts existed for a reason,
  and she wasn't just going to ignore hers.

Unfortunately she'd only come to the decision just as the doors were closing,
  and in her rush to grab her bag the zipper had split open,
  spilling its contents and tripping her so she landed face-first.

She still had the bag itself, but her laptop was missing &mdash;
  probably still on the train &mdash;
  and her phone had fallen into the space between the platform.
She briefly considered jumping down onto the tracks to get it,
  but looking down it was clearly smashed beyond repair.

Angela quickly took inventory of the situation.
At least she still had her medications &mdash; those were the only _really_ expensive thing
  even compared to the laptop (which she was told was top-of-the-line).
She still had her sketchpad and most of her pens, so she wasn't defenseless.
A small folding knife,
  her first aid kit,
  half a sandwich.
Chargers for her destroyed phone and missing laptop,
  and a short extension cord.
Wallet was here &mdash; no cash,
  but she had her ID,
  ATM credit card,
  airline miles card,
  smartTrip card,
  and her employee badge.

She put everything back in her bag and stood back up.
In other circumstances she might have just waited for the next train,
  but right now her instincts were telling her she needed to get moving.

**White House Ops Room**  
*Washington DC*

"This was 41 minutes ago," the operator reported,
  replaying the low-quality security footage one more time.

Ian confirmed. "Yes, that's definitely her."

The footage showed Angela dashing out of the train before falling to the pavement,
  before (presumably) gathering her scattered belongings into her bag and rushing off.
They couldn't make out much, but it was enough.

**Westwood**  
*Bethesda, MD*

After leaving the station Angela initially traveled directly north-west along River Road.
She hadn't been all that confident that this was the correct route,
  but it seemed as good a route as any;
  the metro map showed the red line as running north-west so it likely wasn't too far off.
In any case the businesses near the station were already closed for the evening,
  so it wasn't like she could just ask for directions.

She walked along the road for about forty minutes until she reached another commercial area,
  this one with businesses that were still open.
It took her a few minutes looking through the few maps available at the 7-Eleven,
  but eventually she found a local trail map that set her straight.
She would've been better off taking Wisconsin Avenue from the station,
  but from here it looked like the best option was to take the Capital Crescent Trail to get back on track.

She quickly paid for the map, and headed back on her way.

--------
**Capital Crescent Trail**  
*Bethesda, MD*

Angela jogged along the trail in the dim light,
  taking in the fresh air and the sounds of the environment.
At a dead sprint, she was actually slightly faster than most humans;
  due to her smaller size and the square-cube law, more force compared to her momentum.
For long distance however the average human could easily overtake the average phascolian;
  this was mostly down to their longer stride length and larger energy reserves,
  and despite her own slightly better metabolic efficiency.

After a few minutes, Angela slowed back down to a walk.
There was no denying that this was a very different place from her birth planet.

She remembered quite well the first time she'd been outside a habitation dome,
  once the Kemhe Terraforming Authority had made the announcement that
  it was now safe for her species to travel outside without supplemental oxygen.
At that point the planet's atmosphere was still only _just_ breathable,
  and it was still over a decade until the city she'd grown up in started dismantling some of the inflatable domes.
She remembered 7-year-old her running around outside and getting completely out of breath after a few dozen yards.

Outside of cultivated fields and gardens the planet Kemhe was still largely barren,
  covered mostly with lichens and the occasional patch of hardy grasses,
  but despite this, to 7-year-old her the feeling of being _outside_ with nothing above her,
  seeing the stars with her own eyes had been just magical.
She hadn't ever felt _confined_ by the city, exactly;
  many of the air supported domes were _massive_, spanning miles across,
  and it hadn't been at all crowded &mdash;

Angela was interrupted from her thoughts as someone called out from behind her.

"Hey! Miss!"

Had she dropped something?
She stopped and turned, just in time to spot the man rushing towards her.

The man rapidly closed the remaining distance before, *wham!*
He rammed his forearm into her, shoving Angela down onto the sidewalk.
"WALLET AND PHONE, NOW!"
The man brandished some kind of weapon in the darkness.

Angela was stunned for a moment,
  before realizing what was happening and scrambling back.
She'd lost her phone back at the train station,
  but she pulled out her wallet and tossed it weakly past her attacker.
From this position on the ground she didn't she didn't have much leverage to throw,
  and the wallet landed only just beyond him.

"And &mdash; AND YOUR PHONE!" The attacker demanded, voice choking for a moment on the first word.

"I lost it," Angela managed to make out, terrified and still somewhat disoriented.

The attacker snorted. "Whatever."

As he turned his back and bent over to pick up the wallet,
  Angela scrambled back further, pulling her sketchpad out of her bag
  and trying to take stock of the situation.
The attacker looked to be about 17-18,
  and while he wasn't particularly large for a human,
  he was still easily a foot taller than her and likely twice her weight.
She'd already burned a lot of stamina earlier from jogging,
  so the odds of outrunning him even for a bit weren't great.
And odds were he wouldn't react well to finding out the wallet didn't have any cash.

The attacker stood back up and flopped her wallet open before standing there for a moment, stiff.
Angela had some knowledge of defensive sigils and had prepared a handful of spells earlier,
  but she hadn't ever had to cast under pressure like this before.
If she botched this ...

"Are you bullshitting me!"
Her attacker cried out in frustration, throwing the wallet to the ground.
He turned back to face her where she'd scrambled a dozen feet away.

His eyes fell on her sketchpad, then after a moment roared.
"I don't f\*cking THINK SO!"

She held the pad with the back pointed towards the man and made the last stroke with her pen to activate it.

Nothing happened.
The man stalked toward her, and she dropped the pad, scrambling to try to get away.

Suddenly there was a massive *crack* followed by a scream that wasn't hers,
  and she felt something wet splatter against her face and clothing.

In the disoriented blur that followed Angela
  suddenly found a man wearing a police uniform standing beside her with his gun drawn.

"Miss, miss, are you injured?"

Angela managed to shake her head no.

"Hey, uh, dispatch, this is Officer Edwards,
  just stopped an in-progress mugging, we need medevac ASAP, I've got the perp bleeding out here on the pavement.
The victim's still here, she matches the description, looks like she's disoriented but I don't think she's seriously injured.
Uh huh."

"Miss." The man was addressing her again.
"I need you to sit tight for a moment."

Then, under his breath.
"Jesus this is a real mess."
