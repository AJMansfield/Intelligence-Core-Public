Solomon's doorbell rang, startling him slightly as it pulled him from his thoughts.
He was still recovering from jet-lag, and he hadn't been expecting anyone, especially at his house, on a weekday.
_Did anyone even still do door-to-door sales, in this day and age?_
The security feed to his right showed him a woman in a sun hat,
  accompanied by a fit-looking man wearing a tee-shirt and jeans,
  and as Solomon got up from his chair the doorbell rang again, insistently.

"No thank you, we're not interes&mdash;" he began almost automatically as he opened the door,
  before suddenly recognising who it was.
  
Joyce Toomey, now _she_ was an interesting figure.
She'd first appeared on the scene in 2044 with some sort of archaeology vlog YouTube channel,
  which in following with some seemingly inevitable law
  had gradually descended into clickbait-y conspiracy theories and "aliens", the whole shebang.
His first major interaction with her had been a scene-by-scene debunking of one of her "documentaries",
  done simply to relieve frustration after a particularly trying day at work.
Normally nothing would have come of it,
  but for some reason a few weeks later she'd contacted him asking for his opinion on the Richards Bay disaster,
  a topic he was intimately familiar with given that 19 years prior he had literally _been there for the cover-up_.
Although he'd had to brush it off with a response that was almost purely a rant about pseudoscience and denialism,
  he had been surprised when the video had come up in his recommendations a few weeks later,
  and even more pleasantly surprised at the contents.
The video had had still given far too much credibility to some things he knew were bunk,
  it was on the whole a very even-handed discussion of the events leading up to the disaster,
  especially given the general slant of the channel previously.

He had since then corresponded with her on a fairly regular basis,
  and although he was still bound to secrecy on certain topics he tried to help where he could.
He'd only ever met her in person once, when she'd paid for him to fly out during the whole Puerto Su√°rez debacle,
  and while he still didn't approve of most of what she published,
  it was still head and shoulders above most other publications.

"Good morning," she began, bringing Solomon back to the present.

"Ah yes, I'm sorry, Miss Toomey, and who's this?" Solomon began, indicating the man standing next to her.

"I've been married for nearly a year, it's Mrs. Hart now.
But please, just call me Joyce."
She paused for a moment, before pulling the man forward next to her.
"Oh yeah, Solomon, meet my husband Jack.
Jack, meet Solomon."

Something about this so-named "Jack Hart" bothered Solomon,
  even beyond the artificial-sounding name.
He didn't seem like someone who'd be difficult to work with &mdash;
  to the contrary, he seemed perfectly agreeable &mdash;
  but there was something about the way he carried himself.
  
The man reached out his hand and Solomon shook it.
"My wife seems to think very highly of you, sir, I'm glad to meet you."

_That must be it, he's some sort of ex-military._
Solomon thought to himself, giving Jack a noncommittal nod and a smile before addressing Mrs. Hart.
"I'm somewhat surprised you're here; I only emailed you yesterday.
I assume you must have had an existing engagement out here; I hope this isn't interfering with anything."

"You give yourself too little credit,
  you're well known in the community as an ardent skeptic," Joyce scolded him.
"I know half a dozen people who'd have done anything to be on the next flight over
  if they'd received the email you sent me."

Solomon stood there for a moment feeling slightly awkward before Jack interrupted. "May we come in?"

--------

"OK, but why are you here?" Solomon asked after he had taken a seat.

"Well, we stopped by your office, but you weren't there.
Jack wanted me to text but I thought it would be more fun to surprise you."
Joyce teased.

"No that's&mdash;" Solomon began again, before Jack cut him off.

"I think," Jack began, "that should really be a question for _you_, Mr. Solomon. 
Why _are_ we here?"

"This is about the alien spacesh&mdash;" Solomon began to answer, before Jack cut him off again. 

"You misunderstand.
I've read your email and I know the score.
Why are _we_ here?
What are you hoping to accomplish?"

There was an uncomfortable pause.

"I... I guess I hadn't really thought it out that far.
The typical answers all just seem so shallow."

There was another difficult pause.

"I guess I just wanted to let everyone know, _aliens are real_, they're here, and prove to everyone that we're not alone in the universe.
And I guess protecting earth or whatever probably figures into it somehow."
He sighed.
"We all want to be the hero, after all."

There it was.
That was what he wanted,
  and the pause that followed felt somehow lighter.

"Alright," Jack replied.
"I can work with that."

--------

This was crazy.
This was the sort of shadow government bullsh\*t you'd see on the X-files.
This was the sort of thing you'd expect from sci-fi movie villains.
This was the sort of thing you'd expect to happen in a cheap amateur fiction on reddit.

This was her job.

Lockheed Martin had offered Brenda Hill post-doc position for cognitive science research two months ago,
  and she had accepted it without a second thought.
Although it had been odd the level of background checking and overall secrecy that had been required,
  she had just chalked it up to just bureaucracy.

Apparently, she had been hired to perform "experiments" on an "alien".
She'd been reassured her that the "alien" had "consented" to allow them to conduct "limited tests" on it,
  but assuming any of this was real and not some sort of twisted joke,
  she sincerely doubted how real this "consent" actually was.

In any case she really had no idea what to expect, 
  so when the message that "Angela" had arrived &mdash;
  apparently that was the codename for it &mdash;
  there was little else she could do but go down to the front entrance to escort "Angela" to the lab.

"I'm here for ... Angela?" she asked at the security desk once she got down. It struck her as odd that she'd been called to the personnel entrance rather than deliveries, but things were already too weird for her to question it.

"That's me," came a voice from behind her, and she turned around to see a child wearing a green hoodie, looking to be around 12 or so.

"Uhh, excuse me?" Brenda was confused.

"I've already signed in."
The child held up the guest badge around her neck.
"And your name is?"

"Uh... Brenda?" she stammered.
"I'm sorry, this is all extremely confusing... _you're_" &mdash; and then in a whisper &mdash; "the alien?"

The ~~child~~ **alien** turned toward the hallway Brenda had arrived from.
"Well come on let's go, this is about letting me monitor my health as much as anything."

--------

Whatever Brenda had been expecting, this was the opposite of that.
After she'd regained her composure to escort Angela to the research lab
  (apparently that was her actual name),
  she started going over some initial formalities.

In particular,
  she and the other researchers had prepared an exhaustive set of 'informed consent' paperwork the previous day,
  partially just to cover their asses,
  but really it was meant to be able to give them an excuse to stall until they'd figured out what was going on.

But Angela was having none of that.

"... and water is wet, and sharp things are sharp, and blah&ndash;de&ndash;bla&mdash; is this _normal_ for you guys?"
Angela asked, irritatedly.
"Look, if I didn't '_consent_' to all this I wouldn't _be here_.
This was part of the deal I made, and although appreciate the thoroughness I've had about enough of this."

There was an awkward pause.

"I'm sorry, we didn't really have any idea what to expect,
  we weren't really able to get anything set up for today."
  
Angela glared at her, and then around at the rest of the staff.
"Quite frankly, that's unacceptable.
I'm here for my own benefit as much as for yours."

"I ... I guess it wouldn't take too long to set up some basic perceptual tests?"
one of the other researchers volunteered.

Angela accepted this compromise.
"Sure, just as long as we're actually doing something."

--------

Angela hadn't really known what to expect either from this,
  but she hadn't expected the smothering _apprehensiveness_ that pervaded everything.
She'd flown in to Palmdale, CA the day before with Matt,
  leaving Jessica and Mike to finish packing up the lab back in Salt Lake,
  and wanted to get a start on this portion at least.
She'd actually insisted on conducting tests:
  she knew the data would be needed for designing appropriate life support and provisioning for when she left,
  but more than that she was genuinely curious about how she would stack up against the humans.

Fortunately by mid-morning she'd managed to convince most of the technicians to drop some of the overbearing formality,
  and while she wished they could've started with something more concrete than _perceptual tests_,
  things were at least moving along now.
  
They'd first run her through what was apparently a standard eye exam for humans,
  asking her to identify symbols on a [Snellen chart] through various lenses.
As a side note, apparently she might be able to benefit somewhat from getting prescription lenses,
  something that &mdash; so she was told &mdash; was actually fairly common and readily available,
  despite having been prohibitively expensive for most people on her birth planet.

They'd gone on to testing color vision.
They'd started out with the [Ishihara test],
  showing her cards with patterns of colored dots and asking her to identify a number.
Her test results indicated full color vision,
  but one of the researchers remarked that this test might not even be applicable to her.
After all, the color vision primaries could be completely different,
  so a test designed to detect color-blindness in Humans might not work at all for Phascolians.

They'd then replaced the cards with a set of colored tiles in a lightbox,
  and asked her to sort them by hue.
Apparently this [Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test]
  was a way of more accurately measuring color vision defects in Humans,
  and might provide some insight into how Phascolian color vision differed.
One of the researchers said he'd try to get hold of a spectral light source
  to be able to more directly map her color response curves next time,
  but even this did provide some data:
She had some difficulty distinguishing between some of the blue-ish tiles,
  and although she'd been quite confident about the purple-ish tiles,
    she'd apparently put them in a completely different order than an Human would've,
    likely due to differences in how her cone-cell-analogues responded to the pigment mixtures on the tiles.

There were a few other tests:
  mapping blind spots (she'd had a lot of difficulty keeping her vision focused on the center mark during the test),
  the extent of her peripheral vision (slightly wider vertically than a human, but otherwise about the same),
  sensitivity to polarization (not very, on par with a human),
  pupillary response (this was uncomfortably bright, but she put up with it)
  and a few other things.
The fact that these tests were designed for humans,
  plus the sample size of one,
  meant that these results would have to be taken with a grain of salt,
  but she was overall satisfied with how things were going.

--------

_If aliens had to exist, we must've lucked out to be in a universe with aliens like this,_ Brenda thought to herself.
Angela herself had apparently trained as some sort of medical professional before coming here;
  there wasn't quite an equivalent but it seemed something similar to an MD here,
  but with a few roles that would usually be filled by an RN.
As such she'd actually been extremely helpful with understanding some of the results,
  and it was clear that she was legitimately curious about human medicine and understanding human biology as well.

Most of the tests so far had been less in Brenda's area,
  but Angela had been extremely cooperative,
  and had rapidly blazed through most of the tests they were prepared for.

Thus, it was now her turn again, and Brenda was in her element.

"In this next test we're going to briefly show you a pattern of colored dots on the screen. For each pattern, I want you to state the number of dots in the image, as quickly as you can."

"So you just want me to count them?" Angela looked puzzled.

"Not quite. Each image will only be displayed for a fraction of a second before switching back to blank, and shouldn't give you enough time to count them. This is actually a test of your ability to _[subitizing]_, essentially the ability to instinctively judge the number of objects _without_ counting. A sort of 'number sense', if you will."

--------

Another image blinked on the tablet in front of Angela,
  and she tried her best to assess the number of dots.
"Uhhh... three, I guess?"

This entire test had felt rather arbitrary, and she was glad to be done with it.

"Ok, thank you, that's it for now," Brenda said as she walked back into the room with another researcher.

"How'd I do?"

"Actually, the data from this test is quite interesting, let me show you."
Brenda pulled up a graph on a tablet.
"The exposure length needed to consistently answer correctly appears to be linear with the number of dots, even down to patterns with just one or two dots."

"How is that interesting?" Angela felt puzzled again.
She could see that the data approximated a straight line, but that just made sense.
Counting more things just takes more time, right?

"Well, for a Human, this isn't the case at all."
Brenda pulled up another similar graph,
  but on this one the first several bars showed a response time significantly faster than the global trend.
"In humans, up to about four or five,
  the time required to determine the number of objects is nearly constant,
  it's only when we get up to larger numbers that the same overall trend appears."

Angela could understand being able to instantly tell the difference between zero and one &mdash;
  borne out by the data points &mdash;
  but imagining the concept for four or five felt completely alien to her.
"How does that even work?"

"This is actually something that happens directly in the visual cortex,
  which is why the time is nearly constant for small numbers.
The fact that your graph _doesn't_ do this this is actually incredibly fascinating,
  and implies there are fairly dramatic fundamental differences in how numerical cognition works between Humans and Phascolians.
Assuming you're typical for your species in this regard, I mean."

--------

Angela didn't know what to think as she headed back to the hotel.
On one hand, this result that humans had extraordinary numerical cognition abilities compared to most species was fascinating.
The researchers, especially Brenda, had all seemed really excited about this.
On the other hand, she still couldn't help but feel like the only disabled kid at a playground, at least a tiny bit.
Counting wasn't something she'd learned until well into her second year of schooling,
  and this idea that even young human children had a sort of intuitive numerical understanding was intimidating.

The researchers said they were going to try to get an "FMRI machine" for next time,
  a device that would apparently allow them to directly observe her brain activity for future tests.
Angela hadn't ever even heard of such a capability before,
  and was extremely interested to learn how it worked,
  but the idea that the humans had a machine that could _literally read someone's mind_ was slightly disconcerting.

Fortunately once she arrived she spotted Matt waiting in the lobby.
"Hey, good to see you, hope they didn't probe you too hard."
He grinned at her, forcing the topic from her mind.

"Ugggh, not you too, Mike was bad enough.
There's nothing improper or weird about learning what I can,
  besides we're going to need some of that data to get me off this rock anyhow.
What have you been up to all day?"

"Well, I was able to work out some more permanent apartments pretty close to the main Lockheed campus.
As much as I like staying here,
  it's really not all that convenient to be halfway across the city from where most of the action will be.
Uhh.. I've mostly worked out what area we're going to be using, oh and I got your security badge"
Matt pulled out a card with her name and photograph on it, attached to a shirt clip.
"Apparently you'll still need to stop by the security office tomorrow to activate the RFID chip."

"Thanks." She accepted it from him.

"In other news,
  the linguistics guy they're bringing on, uhh, Doctor McGinnis,
  _apparently_ isn't due here until _next_ week &mdash;
    the VP in charge on Lockheed's side got _pissed_ when that came out,
    apparently there was some miscommunication &mdash;
  but it looks like we're not going to be able to get started on that front right away unfortunately."

Matt paused for a moment, and Angela snorted, feeling peeved, before Matt continued on.

"Oh but they've managed to lock down the trajectory of the orbiter,
  the bit of your craft that's still up in orbit,
  and there's a launch window three weeks from now;
  they're planning to put an observation satellite up in proximity so we can get high-resolution imagery.
That should hopefully be good enough to at least start on some of the engineering work for the replacement pod,
  since they haven't been able to locate the one you landed in &mdash;
  it looks like it's been removed and we're having trouble tracking it down."

"Any _good_ news?"
It wasn't that she disliked being here on Earth or anything,
  but she knew she would need to move on before too long,
  and all these delays were frustrating.

"Uhh, I guess, Mike and Jess are getting here tomorrow evening."

She sighed. It would have to do for now.
