- basic answer: kender party is coalescing into a clan, the way it do
- human is not same as kender
- they consider you 'clan'
- good for you, explain legal rights afforded clan over migrant
- discuss with elderly dude of dying clan, who acts as sort of counselor/priest-dude/etc
  - problem: too many people, proto-clan roster is cycling real fast and can't keep track of everyone
  - already too many of them
- Confucious say:
  - is what love is like
  - perhaps problem is not with others. maybe problem is with you
  - you come from place of small clans, these others grown up in large clans
  - to them it probably feels like you're mean/picky/not willing to compromise on new members to complete the set
  - everyone has to compromise on something, some more than others
  - you see treebranch, is sturdy. but when rain come it bend, rather than break
  - consider now, rock. mighty strong. Rain comes, not moved.
  - If _big_ rain come, maybe even still not move. But if not still here, _gone_. Is _nowhere_.
  - You can be like tree branch, or you can be like rock.
  - Be like branch and bend, you can still stand tall after the rain.
  - Be like rock, maybe you get your way. And maybe, they leave you behind.
  - maybe, this group is not your destiny, although it has likely helped you on your way to it
  - you must look inside, and find out for yourself, are you stick, or are you rock.
- understand what you say
  - I need to stop worrying, and just trust that the others can determine for themselves whether a proposed member is a good fit
  - but, they still look to me for approval. Nicknames as a form of approval.
  - Should I just blindly _grant_ my approval?
  - What if I approve someone dangerous/bad and they keep them because of it and we get hurt.
- confucious say:
  - you give yourself too much credit
  - and if what you say is true, who are you to say they're wrong to trust your judgement?
- I'm all running out of judgement
  - that's just it though, when it was just a handful I was able to know all of them
  - but there's no way I can keep track of all of them
  - humans don't bond that quickly?
- confucious say:
  - you worry they rely on you more than you are able?
  - and if you worry so, talk to them.
  - Maybe 
  - 
  - kenders is no sexe, human man need human wuman
- 
  - soap-opera grade drama to them
  - trying to find group that fir

kai retrieves the scrap,
the two migrants help him with this.
kai is careful to hide it
tries to give it to work crew clan

fence it off through the two

writing notes in English
"wait are you ... you know their language?"

"what, what language"

"this language ... the one spoken by the ... tries to find a word ... "americans" like in the stories?

burst out laughing, looks embarrassed

"I'll let you in on a little secret. I don't just speak and read their language.
I am a Human, from Earth, from Canada.
I guess if you're speaking geographically,
  you could say I _am_ an american,
  although usually people used that term to mean the people from the country just south of where I lived.
"

"can you fix this?"
hands him a nokia phone

what happened to it? those are supposed to be indestructable, according to legend.

_I didn't do anything!_ Well, ok, I dropped it. But I put everything back!

pulls off the back cover of the phone, sees the battery is in upside-down and backwards.

Flips the battery around and hands it back

she presses the power button, and it turns back on

jaws hit the floor
another halfling seen't it jaw drops

"are you ...." whispers: "I.T."

Oh boy. What have you gotten yourself into now?

----

soon, you're important.

some kind of mysterious god of technology

attracting attention

he's not part of a halfling clan, but the clan forms anyway, centered around him
the talk of family makes himself lonely

members of other species were rare, odds of encountering another human by chance were slim
still, now that his presence was becoming more widely known, maybe _they'd_ be able to find _him_

buys up functional electronics from junk traders
keep an eye out for functional hard drives, particularily ones that still have earth media on them - videos, games, etc.

called by an allied city-state to fix some kind of system they purchased that's stopped working
no long-range comms

travels to the allied city-state
from what they'd written about the "evil portents" they apparently were getting repeated BSODs,
  and if what they'd written was accurate, they were probably running frikking windows _XP_.

wore formal 'wizard robes'

enters the main gate
there, is another _human_, being denied entry by the guard. a wuman.

"is there a problem?" in english

"{what?}" to him and companions

translator: "is there a problem?"

"{who the hell are you?}"

pulls out his papers, wax seal and embossed foil and everything
he takes one glance at that seal

"{there's no problem sir. we're just keeping out this {derrogatory-term for non-halfling}}"
(can understand, the've reciprocated into his translator's dialect)

gulps, realizing kai is also a {non-halfling}

she: "they took my bribe but they still won't let me in" english

kai: "will this satisfy your greed?" in low halfling language,
implying he's too important to linguistically reciprocate further than that

places an entire de-lidded CPU on the table, silicon diffracting the light into a rainbow of colors.
this one was broken, but it was still considered valuable

gulps. looks at your papers, and inches away from the CPU, then places the bracelet back on the table next to it,
  along with city tokens for his party

"one more, if you would"

looks like he's about to object, but then drops another one

"thank you."
k grabs it and tosses it and the bracelet to the chick
all walk into the city

"thanks for that. don't think I owe you or anything though, not interested"

chuckles

"well, i'm gonna be in town for a few more days, maybe I can change your mind"

where are you go?

city lord's computer is broken, called for the only wizard to come fix it for him

oof, that's why I never tell anyone I'm a human, they all think that means I'm some kind of computer god

I've never even _seen_ Earth, I don't even know

can you read English?
kinda

well that's better than most people out here

90% of the time IT is just, you know, actually _reading_ what's on the screen, and doing what it says, even back on earth.
not that much is different, just because the customer actually _can't_, not just _won't_.

----

part ways

a _human_.. a _woman_

he'd seen his halfling men hitting on women within the clan/tribe when one of them was 'in heat'
apparently there was some sort of complexion change combined with a pheremonal cue that the men found extremely attractive,
and would try to woo any females

brief outline of how halfling reproduction works

Didn't really know _anything_ about _human_ women.
Never been successful at dating in high school.

joined millitary, his side loses some kind of engagement, he's forced to engage hyperdrive to flee,
only he'd been hit, knocking him off course,
  and he hadn't been able to correct his trajectory until it was too late to not go interstellar.
apparently, not exactly an _uncommon_ mode of failure for these craft, which was why his ship had had had the survival stuff

all of his friends and family back home were probably long dead by now, but at least you'd managed to survive, in this foreign land

trip had somehow managed to fry the hyperdrive,
  forced to try to land

still, had to try, she was beautiful

IT was slow careful work. Computer equipment was practically irreplaceable out here.
If you broke something major, getting another that would work could cost you a king's ransom.

what is 'puter used for?
- military crypto
- medical imaging
- tabulation, statistics
- engineering calculations
- running other computerized equipment
  - cnc / 3d printer
  - human spaceships
  - human airplanes
- vidya gaems

----

dates, woos, marries

dynamic between his own family and his kender clan
