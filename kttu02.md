----

You hike along the now gravel road, approaching closer to the domes of the settlement ahead,
  when you first encounter them.
A group of small humanoids that look to be around four feet tall,
  laboring in one of the fields along the road.

Their skin color varies, some what tan but easily within the range of human skin colors,
  and they wear fabric cover-alls, long-sleeved shirts, and gloves to protect themselves.

They even have hair on their heads, of a sort,
  although as you get closer it looks more like long stringy feathers than your own hair.
Several of them have a colorful stripe down the middle.

As you pass, one of them waves and hails you in an alien tonge,
  calling in a seemingly-friendly way.

This work crew is harvesting the tubers you saw earlier,
  twisting to uproot them, cutting off and discarding the leafy tops.
The cut tubers are stacked in piles before being loaded onto a small trailer behind a suitably-sized tractor.

No reason to be unfriendly back.
In fact, as you wave in response, you realize this could be the perfect opportunity.

You set down your pack and retrieve your knife,
  then step into the field,
  immitating the process you just saw performed.
With your size, you're able to pull up the tubers easily,
  and after a moment you've managed to uproot and decapitate a half-dozen of them.

The worker loading the stacks into the trailer has paused to look at you,
  uncertain of your intent,
  and you carry the six you've harvested over to stack them in the trailer yourself.
You could easily carry more than six, but this helps clarify your intent.
Nothing like a bit of free labor to help put any fear at ease.

Despite your size, this is still hard work.
You've been able to adjusted some to the lower oxygen atmosphere,
  but you still occasionally gasp for air,
  and sweat drips down your back.

As you work, you do occasionally see one of the others watching you.
Perhaps they're simply puzzled by the strange hulking giant that randomly showed up and decided to help,
  although you like to think they're impressed with your strength and speed,
  as the stacks of tubers beside you grow.

Eventually, as the sun reaches its zenith,
  one of the workers &mdash; possibly the crew's foreman &mdash;
  calls a break.

The dozen or so laborers congregate by the trailer,
  sitting on stacks of tubers that have yet to be loaded,
  and pass around canteens of water.

You retrieve one of your canteens from where you left your bag,
  and drink thirstily,
  before pulling out one of your ration bars.

The foreman calls over to you, again in a language you don't understand,
  but it's clear he's invited you to join them by the trailer,
  and you do.

Many of the crew are clearly nervous with your presence, though,
  and make only minimal conversation among themselves.
They all appear to be eating some sort of flatbread,
  and you munch on your ration bar in silence.

Eventually, you break the silence.

"These things must be good eating.
Seein' as you're growing them everywhere it seems," you say,
  indicating the stacked tubers.

"Eating?" the foreman asks, with a slight tilt of the head,
  and made an affirmative-looking hand gesture.
"Good, good eating!" He picks up a tuber and hands it to you,
  and you accept it, not sure what else to do.

"Good eating!" he says again, with emphasis, and after a moment pantomimes taking a bite out of it.

The rest of the crew is watching, and so you take a bite.

Immediately gag from the taste.
The raw tuber is incredibly bitter.

But as you look around, the crew seems to find this ... _funny_.
Was this intended as a joke?

You decide to take it that way,
  and so rather than immediately spitting it out,
  you force yourself to grin.

"Good, good eating! You want?"
He offered it back to the foreman.
The crew's gaze turned to him, and he accepted it reluctantly, as if he was being pressured into it.

The foreman eyed the tuber nervously.

This _was_ meant as a joke.

At that moment you couldn't hold it any more, and spat out the chunk of the tuber,
  coughing and laughing.
The rest of the crew followed, making a sound that was fairly analagous.

"Good eating!" you state again, emphatically,
  before rinsing your mouth out with water from your canteen
  and spitting out onto the ground.

Clearly, this was all meant in good fun, and the foreman joins the laughter,
  relieved he won't be forced to take a bite himself.
Even for them, these tubers require processing to be edible.

In that moment, the ice breaks, and conversation flows freely.
You don't understand most of their words,
  but you don't need to to understand that you'd been judged and found worthy.
You just follow along as best you can &mdash; you'll need to learn the local language eventually &mdash;
  and comment in your own language as it seems appropriate.

"What's the word for these tuber things anyway?" you find yourself asking,
  holding the one you'd bitten almost as a trophy.

"Word? _tsutssupkan_," replies the workman beside you,
  and points at another of the tubers,
  to ensure you understand that he's giving the name for this root in case he misunderstood the question.

He pronounces the word with a particular emphasis on the _ss_ and a very subtle _k_ sound that you're not quite sure you can reproduce,
  but you nod, confirming that that was what you had asked, and try your best anyway to say it back.

"Tsoo-tsoop-kan," you say.

"Tsutssupkan." He nods back, and this time pronounces it the way you did.

He pauses for a moment, then asks, "word for ... you?"

"Kai. My name is Kai." You point to yourself.

"Small word, for big ..." he motions at you, indicating your large relative size.

"I guess so," you say. "So what's your name?"

----

You work alongside the ... what were you going to refer to them as?

They'd identified as '_Ksip-pukt-sim-nmi_' or something like that,
  using some subtle alien pronounciations that your human mouth couldn't quite articulate,
  but you had a sense that this was a name for just this particular group,
  and you hadn't quite been able to communicate desire to know their name for the species as a whole.

Anyway, you work alongside the halflings for several more hours,
  until finally the field is harvested.
The trailer is stacked full of the tubers,
  and you retrieve your pack to follow the crew as they walk behind it to the city up ahead.

As you walk, the foreman &mdash; who'd identified as '_Ye-o-ne-e_' and who'd accepted your nickname 'Leon',
  poses a question to you.
"Where was Kai go?"

"I don't really have anywhere. I guess, with you? To the city?"
You gesticulate to illustrate your meaning as best you can.

You'd expected to have to learn the local language,
  but the fact they were willing &mdash; and for that matter _able_ &mdash; to learn yours,
  _this_ rapidly, had been a surprise.

He frowns for a moment before attempting to clarify.
"I mean, where was Kai go .. go _before_?"

You sigh, memories you'd rather forget returning, of your old life on Earth.
"I come from a long, _long_ way from here."

"From ... up?" He indicates the sky.

You suppose that's accurate.

"Many of us, too, come from up, before here."

----

Finally, you approach the entrance to the city.
In addition to the large domes you'd seen from afar,
  there are many smaller domes scattered around,
  some seemingly isolated, others connected by small tunnels.

There's also other, smaller outbuildings, not covered by any dome,
  and you see trickles of both foot and vehicular traffic move in and out of a squat building at the edge of the dome,
  large roll doors opening and closing with each wave.

Your theory that these were air-supported domes appears to have been correct.

All the people you see are of the same halfling species as the group you follow,
  although there's significant color variation,
  skin tones ranging from deep oranges and pale tans to burnt reds and dark browns.

Although, as you look again,
  beneath the grime your group itself has quite a bit of variation, even just between its own members.

You follow the group into one of the smaller entrance buildings.
The trailer is rolled onto a truck scale and unhitched from the tractor,
  and the rest of the group stands around as Leon speaks to some kind of uniformed official stationed here.

The language they're speaking is very different from the one the crew had used among themselves earlier,
  although there were _some_ similarities.
You pick out the word _tsutssupkan_ again,
  but you almost miss it; pronounciation was _quite_ different from the version you'd learned.

After a moment though, the conversation starts becoming more heated.
Both of them are gesticulating towards you, and you hear your name used.

Leon breaks off and stalks back,
  wearing an expression you interpret as frustration.

"The ... " he gesticulates, and you fill in.

"Guard?"

"The guard, he wants ..."
He indicates the ring you wear on your finger.
"Or not give ... not let you in."

The meaning was clear.
The guard &mdash; probably more customs official &mdash;
  expected a bribe, in exchange for some kind of ID card or token you'd need to be allowed in the city.

As much as the memory associated with that ring pains you,
  it still wasn't one you wished to give up.

"Is there anything else I can give him?" you ask,
  as you try to figure out what else you had that they might be willing to accept.

Several other members of the crew obviously didn't like this eather,
  and one of them spat on the floor.
"Not his to say."

Your mental search comes up empty.
And you can't exactly afford coming into conflict with the authorities this early on.

The crew seems to be getting agitated,
  and another uniformed halfling tightens their grip on what was most definitely a halfling-sized assault rifle.

This wasn't worth getting into trouble over.
You put up your hand, and slip the ring off.

"It's ok, I'll pay the bribe," you say.

You hand the ring over, and the official slips it into a small pouch at his waist.
He hands you an official-looking form covered in alien heiroglyphics.

Leon sees your confusion, and waves the rest of the crew ahead,
  taking the form from you and filling out most of it before sliding it back.

"How you ..." he pantomimes moving his pen.

"Write?"

"Write." He nods. He points to one of the remaining boxes, and then to another.
"How you write name of Kai, and how you write where you're from."

He hands you the pen.

You're no judge of alien writing, but Leon's is incredibly neat and tidy,
  in perfect vertical columns with straight lines and precise circles.
If it weren't for the small dots of ink at the beginning and end of each stroke and the impressions in the page,
  you might have thought it typewritten.

The first two fields make sense at least,
  and you write out 'K-A-I' as neatly as you can in block letters,
  then 'E-A-R-T-H'.

Leon looks over the form,
  then hands it to the official.

The official pulls out a round plastic disc the size of a bottle cap,
  covered on one side with some kind of geometric seal.
He flips it over, and writes something on the other side,
  then hands it to you,
  saying something that you take to mean "don't cause any trouble."

You nod. You don't want any trouble.
You thread the disc onto a lanyard so you don't lose it.

At last, you're able to exit the gatehouse, and enter the city proper.

small communes of around 20 adults of both sexes
Work crew offered him a place to stay for a few days, while he got his bearings in the city.
He spent most of the day working in the fields with this crew.




spoken languages were apparently very fluid for kender.

It was often said on Earth that English was really three languages in a trenchcoat, robbed other languages in dark alleys and going through their pockets for loose grammar.

If that was the case, the ... _languages_, if the term really even still applied,
  that these kenders spoke was some kind of unholy abomination that had been pulled directly from some primordial soup of elemental chaos.

Across even _this_ small settlement of about ten thousand people,
  there wasn't just _one_ common language, or even _two_.
There were literally _thousands_ of distinct dialects and languages,
  all bleeding into each other in a horible convoluted mess.

As far as can tell, there _were_ a relatively small number of common-ish pidgin languages &mdash; maybe a half-dozen &mdash;
  but these were really only ever used when starting a conversation with a stranger,
  and in real conversation would rapidly evolve into some kind of ad-hoc 'best common subset' language common to its participants.

On the plus side,
  he'd managed to get a handle on the most common pidgin 'greeting language' used here,
  and he was able to conduct most business using a mix of _English_ with this pidgin,
  using grammar and vocabulary many of the kenders had somehow just _picked up_ interacting with him.
But at the same time,
  by using that greeting language he was basically greeting everyone as a stranger all the time &mdash;
  making him a sort of permanent foreigner &mdash;
  and the lack of 'linguistic reciprocity' in these exchanges
  generally gave the impression that he was somewhat dim-witted or perhaps childish.

Dammit, you _tried_.
Your brain just wasn't built for this kind of thing.
Still, when one of them introduced one of their own terms to a conversation,
  you did your best to _try_ to remember and use it, at least for that conversation;
  show you were at least _trying_ to reciprocate.

the roots are indeed mashed and washed to separate out the starch.

This was used to make a slightly-sour-tasting flatbread that formed the main staple of their diet.

Occasionally it would be served with communal dishes of various fillings that you used the flatbread to pick up and then ate with it,
  but this was something of a luxury at least among the lower classes;
  these fillings were to provide variety, not to fill you up, and often the bread was just served plain.
  
Unfortunately many of the spices they often used in cooking weren't really edible for him,
  tasting at best kind of funny and at worst downright acrid.

There were a handful he could stomach - some kind of greens with a mild citrus-y flavor,
  and this other sweet potato analogue that was mildly spicy,
  needed to start growing his own crops.

kai made it into a wrap
  
  or used to make a kind of wrap with fillings inside it,
  
It was sometimes served with fillings, which were grabbed with a piece of flatbread
better than nutrient bars though
