----

You hike along the now gravel road, approaching closer to the domes of the settlement ahead,
  when you first encounter them.
A group of small humanoids that look to be around four feet tall,
  laboring in one of the fields alongside the road.

Coloration is quite varied, but easily within the range of human skin colors,
  and they wear fabric cover-alls, long-sleeved shirts, and gloves to protect themselves.

They even have hair on their heads, of a sort,
  although as you get closer it looks more like long stringy feathers than your own hair.
You note that several of them have a contrasting stripe down the middle of their hair.

As you pass, one of them waves and hails you in an alien tonge,
  calling in a seemingly friendly way.

This work crew is harvesting the tubers you saw earlier,
  twisting to uproot them, cutting off and discarding the leafy tops.
The cut tubers are stacked in piles before being loaded onto a small trailer behind a suitably-sized tractor.

No reason to be unfriendly back.
In fact, as you wave in response, you realize this could be the perfect opportunity.

You set down your pack and retrieve your knife,
  then step into the field,
  immitating the process you just saw performed.
With your size, you're able to pull up the tubers easily,
  and after a moment you've managed to uproot and decapitate a half-dozen of them.

The worker loading the stacks into the trailer has paused to look at you,
  uncertain of your intent,
  and you carry the six you've harvested over to stack them in the trailer yourself.
You could easily carry more than six, but this helps clarify your intent.
Nothing like a bit of free labor to help put any fear at ease.

Despite your size, this is still hard work.
You've been able to adjusted some to the lower oxygen atmosphere,
  but you still occasionally gasp for air,
  and sweat drips down your back.

As you work, you do occasionally see one of the others watching you.
Perhaps they're simply puzzled by the strange hulking giant that randomly showed up and decided to help,
  although you like to think they're impressed with your strength and speed,
  as the stacks of tubers beside you grow.

Eventually, the sun reaches its zenith,
  and one of the workers &mdash; possibly the crew's foreman &mdash;
  calls a break.

The twenty or so laborers congregate by the trailer,
  sitting on stacks of tubers that have yet to be loaded,
  and pass around canteens of water.

You retrieve one of your canteens from where you left your bag,
  and drink thirstily,
  before pulling out one of your ration bars.

The foreman calls over to you, again in a language you don't understand,
  but it's clear he's invited you to join them by the trailer,
  and you do.

Many of the crew are clearly nervous with your presence, though,
  and make only minimal conversation among themselves.
They all appear to be eating some sort of flatbread,
  and you munch on your ration bar in silence.

Eventually, you break the silence.

"These things must be good eating.
Seein' as you're growing them everywhere it seems," you say,
  indicating the stacked tubers.

"Eating?" the foreman asks, with a slight tilt of the head,
  and made an affirmative-looking hand gesture.
"Good, good eating!" He picks up a tuber and hands it to you,
  and you accept it, not sure what else to do.

"Good eating!" he says again, with emphasis, and after a moment pantomimes taking a bite out of it.

The rest of the crew is watching, and so you take a bite.

You immediately retch from the taste.
The raw tuber is incredibly bitter.

But as you look around, the crew seems to find this ... _funny_.
Was this some sort of practical joke, played at his expense?

You decide to take it that way,
  and so rather than immediately spitting it out,
  you force yourself to grin.

"Good, good eating! You want some?"
He offered it back to the foreman.
The crew's gaze turned to him, and he accepted it reluctantly, as if they were all now pressuring _him_ into it.

The foreman eyed the tuber nervously.

This _was_ meant as a joke.

At that moment you couldn't hold it any more, and spat out the chunk of the tuber,
  coughing and laughing.
The rest of the crew followed, making a sound that was fairly analagous.

"Good eating!" you state again, emphatically,
  before rinsing your mouth out with water from your canteen
  and spitting out onto the ground.

Clearly, this was all meant in good fun, and the foreman joins the laughter,
  relieved he won't be forced to take a bite himself.
Even for them, these tubers require processing to be edible.

In that moment, the ice breaks, and conversation flows freely.
You don't understand most of their words,
  but you don't need to to understand that you'd been judged and found worthy.
You just follow along as best you can &mdash; you'll need to learn the local language eventually &mdash;
  and comment in your own language as it seems appropriate.

"What's the word for these tuber things anyway?" you find yourself asking,
  holding the one you'd bitten almost as a trophy.

"Word? _tsutssupkan_," replies the workman beside you,
  and points at another of the tubers,
  to ensure you understand that he's giving the name for this root in case he misunderstood the question.

He pronounces the word with a particular emphasis on the _ss_ and a very subtle _k_ sound that you're not quite sure you can reproduce,
  but you nod, confirming that that was what you had asked, and try your best anyway to say it back.

"Tsoo-tsoop-kan," you say.

"Tsutssupkan." He nods back, and this time pronounces it the way you did.

He pauses for a moment, then asks, "word for ... you?"

"Kai. My name is Kai." You point to yourself.

"Small word, for big ..." he motions at you, indicating your large relative size.

"I guess so," you say. "So what's your name?"

----

You work alongside the ... what were they, exactly, anyway?

They group had identified as '_Ksip-pukt-sim-nmi_' or something of the sort,
  using some subtle alien pronounciations that your human mouth couldn't quite articulate,
  but that appeared to be a name for this group in particular,
  and you hadn't quite been able to communicate desire to know their name for the species as a whole.

Anyway, you work alongside the halflings for several more hours,
  until finally the field is harvested.
The trailer is stacked full of the tubers,
  and you retrieve your pack to follow the crew as they walk behind it to the city up ahead.

As you walk, the foreman &mdash; who'd identified as '_Ye-o-ne-e_' and who'd accepted your nickname 'Leon',
  poses a question to you.
"Where was Kai go?"

"I don't really have anywhere. I guess, with you? To the city?"
You gesticulate to illustrate your meaning as best you can.

You'd expected to have to learn the local language,
  but the fact they were willing &mdash; and for that matter _able_ &mdash; to learn yours,
  _this_ rapidly, had been a surprise.

He frowns for a moment before attempting to clarify.
"I mean, where was Kai go .. go _before_?"

You sigh, memories you'd rather forget returning, of your old life on Earth.
"I come from a long, _long_ way from here."

"From ... up?" He indicates the sky.

You suppose that's accurate.

"Many of us, too, come from up, before here."

----

Finally, you approach the entrance to the city.
In addition to the large domes you'd seen from afar,
  there are many smaller domes scattered around,
  some seemingly isolated, others connected by small tunnels.

There's also other, smaller outbuildings, not covered by any dome,
  and you see trickles of both foot and vehicular traffic move in and out of a squat building at the edge of the dome,
  large roll doors opening and closing with each wave.

Your theory that these were air-supported domes appears to have been correct.

All the people you see are of the same halfling species as the group you follow,
  although there's significant color variation,
  skin tones ranging from deep oranges and pale tans to burnt reds and dark browns.

Although, as you look again,
  beneath the grime your group itself has quite a bit of variation, even just between its own members.

You follow the group into one of the smaller entrance buildings.
The trailer is rolled onto a truck scale and unhitched from the tractor,
  and the rest of the group stands around as Leon speaks to some kind of uniformed official stationed here.

The language they're speaking is very different from the one the crew had used among themselves earlier,
  although there were _some_ similarities.
You pick out the word _tsutssupkan_ again,
  but you almost miss it; pronounciation was _quite_ different from the version you'd learned.

After a moment though, the conversation starts becoming more heated.
Both of them are gesticulating towards you, and you hear your name used.

Leon breaks off and stalks back,
  wearing an expression you interpret as frustration.

"The ... " he gesticulates, and you fill in.

"Guard?"

"The guard, he wants ..."
He indicates the ring you wear on your finger.
"Or not give ... not let you in."

The meaning was clear.
The guard &mdash; probably more customs official &mdash;
  expected a bribe, in exchange for some kind of ID card or token you'd need to be allowed in the city.

As much as the memory associated with that ring pains you,
  it still wasn't one you wished to give up.

"Is there anything else I can give him?" you ask,
  as you try to figure out what else you had that they might be willing to accept.

Several other members of the crew obviously didn't like this eather,
  and one of them spat on the floor.
"Not his to say."

Your mental search comes up empty.
And you can't exactly afford coming into conflict with the authorities this early on.

The crew seems to be getting agitated,
  and another uniformed halfling tightens their grip on what was most definitely a halfling-sized assault rifle.

This wasn't worth getting into trouble over.
You put up your hand, and slip the ring off.

"It's ok, I'll pay the bribe," you say.

You hand the ring over, and the official slips it into a small pouch at his waist.
He hands you an official-looking form covered in alien heiroglyphics.

Leon sees your confusion, and waves the rest of the crew ahead,
  taking the form from you and filling out most of it before sliding it back.

"How you ..." he pantomimes moving his pen.

"Write?"

"Write." He nods. He points to one of the remaining boxes, and then to another.
"How you write name of Kai, and how you write where you're from."

He hands you the pen.

You're no judge of alien writing, but Leon's is incredibly neat and tidy,
  in perfect vertical columns with straight lines and precise circles.
If it weren't for the small dots of ink at the beginning and end of each stroke and the impressions in the page,
  you might have thought it typewritten.

The first two fields make sense at least,
  and you write out 'K-A-I' as neatly as you can in block letters,
  then 'E-A-R-T-H'.

Leon looks over the form,
  then hands it to the official.

The official pulls out a white plastic disc the size of a half-dollar coin,
  covered on one side with some kind of colorful geometric seal.
He flips it over, and writes something on the other side,
  then hands it to you,
  saying something that you take to mean "don't cause any trouble."

You nod. You don't want any trouble.
You also definitely don't want to lose it.
You use the small hole at the disc's perimeter to thread it onto a lanyard.

At last, you're able to exit the gatehouse, and enter the city proper.

----

You spend most of your first week in the city adjusting to the city's norms.

The _Ksippuktsimnmi_ clan you've fallen in with seems to have around twenty members,
  most of which you met working in the field the first day,
  and about two thirds which you've learned are actually female.

Although to your eyes,
  about the only difference you're able to make out between the sexes is that it's _usually_ men
  who have a colored stripe in the middle of their head hair.
It's definitely not a hard-and-fast rule though.
To them there's apparently differences in facial structure or something that are blatantly obvious.

Most of the city's adult population are apparently part of similar small clans of ten to thirty-odd members,
  but there's also another category of people who live here, a kind of 'migrant worker' class
  that seems to consist of mostly younger adults of the species,
  and generally live in a separate district of the city.

You and four others of the crew are considered part of this migrant worker class,
  and for the moment, you stay with two of the migrants, who you manage to coerce the nicknames "Jerry" and "Morgan" from.
Even without a third occupant of your size the space would've felt crowded,
  but you make do, and are grateful for it.
Apparently unemployment and homelessness are common among this migrant population,
  and you often passed alleyways in these districts containing lean-tos and make-shift shelters.

Crime, though, &mdash; aside from the petty corruption you've experienced firsthand &mdash;
  seemed to be nearly nonexistant,
  likely due to the city government's brutal justice system.

If one were arrested and convicted of a crime, the only possible outcome was execution.

For some crimes at least,
  it seemed you could opt for immediate summary exile from the city rather than contesting any accusation,
  but even then, criminals were usually given a brand indicating the crime they were accused of.
And on _this_ unforgiving planet,
  depending on the time of year that might not be _better_ than execution, just slower.

You do your best to stay out of trouble.

One thing you do have significant trouble with though, is the language.

It is often said on Earth that the English language is really three languages stacked on top of each other wearing a trench coat.
That it regularly pursues other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifles their pockets for new vocabulary.

If that is the case, the ... _languages_, if that was even the right term for what these halflings speak,
  is some kind of eldrich abomination wrested from the elemental chaos and given flesh.

Across even _this_ small city,
  there isn't just _one_ language, or even a dozen.
There are literally _thousands_ of distinct languages and dialects, in _regular use_,
  all bleeding into each other in a horible convoluted mess.

At least within a single clan,
  there are usually one or two reasonably-consistent languages or dialects used within the clan for _most_ purposes.

And, as far as you can tell, there _are_ a half-dozen pidgin 'greeting languages' that most people in the city know.

But, these are basically only ever used when initiating conversation with a total stranger,
  or as a starting point for when two speakers weren't sure what else they had in common.

Yes, _starting point_.

Interactions between strangers might _start_ in one of these 'greeting languages',
  but by the end of the conversation it will have morphed into a kind of ad-hoc 'best common subset' language,
  one that might possibly be _unique_ to _that specific interaction_.

It was a blessing, then, that nobody really cares if you speak any of it _correctly_.
And those you frequently interact with are also, most of the time, _perfectly willing_ to use
  whatever English they'd _somehow_ managed to just _pick up_ by interacting with you.

All things considered,
  you'd done a remarkable job getting a handle on the most-commonly-used pidgin language and some key local vocabulary.
You can even make yourself understood,
  most of the time.

But the fact you can only really speak that minimal pidgin subset
  marks you as a foreigner in a way that even your large relative size doesn't.
And the lack of a sort of 'linguistic reciprocity' in most of your exchanges
  generally leaves others with the impression that you're somewhat dim-witted or perhaps childish.

Dammit, you _try_.
When someone introduces one of their own terms in a conversation,
  you do your best to try to infer the meaning and remember it, at least for that conversation.
It at least shows you're _trying_ to reciprocate;
  'dim-witted' is certainly a step up from 'intentionally rude'.

Your brain just isn't _built_ to handle this sort of linguistic insanity.

----

It's the end of the halfling work-week,
  and you sit beside the other hired workers at at a table outside the _Ksippuktsimnmi_ clan hall,
  putting away the soft, slightly spongy flatbread that forms their main dietary staple.

The bread is made largely from refined _tsutssupkan_ starch,
  and isn't incredibly flavorful,
  but it is filling, and today there's an unusually large assortment of other dishes along with it.
There are no utensils; 
  you simply use a piece of flatbread to scoop or grab some filling directly from the communal dishes,
  and then eat it and the flatbread together.

This is something of a luxury, at least among poorer clans in the city like _Ksippuktsimnmi_.
Most of the time the bread is simply eaten plain,
  with a minimal amount of other food simply for nutrition and variety.
Today though, there is more than enough even for you,
  and you don't have to worry about recieving reproachful looks for eating too much.

Many of their spices and flavorings aren't really edible for you, unfortunately.
None of it actually smells unpleasant, and mostly the inedible spices simply taste kinda bitter,
  but you steer clear of anything that's even remotely yellow, 
  still remembering the acrid taste from two nights ago.

But salt, fat, sugar, and acid are universal.
The leafy green things with the mild citrus-y flavor are pleasant enough,
  as are what looks like some sort of stewed melon-y gourd thing,
  and the greasy gelatin noodle thing.

You really need to start growing some of your own crops.
While you're able to get enough calories, your vitamin tablets are going to last you only so long.

Your thoughts turn to the rover you left at the far side of the canyon.
Most of the equipment you'll need is still there,
  and as far as you've been able to discern there's no way to actually drive it here without going thousands of miles out of your way.
Perhaps you can rig a rope across the canyon and bring it across on a pulley,
  but you'd need to acquire those things first,
  and doing it purely by yourself would take a very long time.

Things come to a close, and Leon approaches you and the others.
He hands each of you a stack of plastic chips similar to  something, and you're able to get the gist of what he says to them.
Apparently, today is also payday.

----

The coins in your hand are similar to the plastic badge you recieved earlier from the city gatehouse,
  but bear a very different &mdash; but still colorful &mdash; geometric design.

In addition to fourteen intact coins, there were also five wedges presumably cut from other coins,
  like old-fasioned pieces of eight.

These plastic coins are rather light in your large hands though,
  and you're not really sure of their value.
Presumably the larger ones are worth more, but how much more?

Probably first on your list is getting your own place.
Sleeping on Morgan and Jerry's metaphorical couch (read: floor) is certainly better than sleeping in the street,
  but even if you'd had it all to yourself this tiny single room apartment would've been cramped.

Dammit, you need more space, and some privacy would certainly be nice, too.

But what can you even afford, on your wage?
You didn't really have any sense for how much any of these coins were worth.

And for that matter, who did you go through to get a place?
Did the city government own it all, or were there individual landlords you'd rent from?

As you consider this, sitting against the wall of the tiny room,
  Morgan enters and sees you.

"Is ... is there a problem?"

You sigh.
Both she &mdash; you're pretty sure it's a she &mdash;
  and Jerry are reasonably proficient in English by this point, _somehow_,
  but this wasn't meant passive-agressively or anything.
It's an actual question.

"Just, not sure how to proceed.
I know I need to get a bigger place &mdash;"
  you gesticulate, indicating the small size of the apartment "&mdash;
  but I don't really know anything about how things work in this city.

"I don't even know what the different coins are worth,
  even if I found the right person to ask about my own place,
  how do I know they're not taking advantage of me to overcharge me?"
You sigh again and set the fistful of plastic chips on the floor in front of you.

"I guess the other big problem,
  is how to get the rest of my stuff across the canyon from where I had to leave it.
I've got some ideas for _how_ to do it,
  but I don't even know where to get the stuff I'd need."

While you vent, she sits down on the floor and counts through the coins.
"That's not very much," she admits after a moment.
"But maybe? I know a bigger place, maybe I can make a deal for not too much."

You hadn't noticed Jerry enter, but he speaks up now.
"What is your other stuff across the canyon? We can help."

----

True to her word, Morgan was able to find a larger place,
  one that was much larger, and, thank god,
  with its own shower and bathroom instead of the single communal bathroom per floor in the old place.
There's even a table and chairs,
  and a small balcony.

There was, though, apparently some mismatch in expectations,
  as you're now sharing it with not just Morgan and Jerry,
  but also the two other migrant-class workers from the crew,
  Nydia and Eli (or so you've nicknamed them, anyway).

You guess it makes sense.
By splitting the rent five ways you _are_ able to get more square footage per dollar,
  or whatever units these halflings measure that kind of thing with.
Given how much of a mess language is here, you're not sure if you want to open that can of worms.

In any case, over the next week &mdash; here, nine days &mdash;
  with the help of Jerry in particular you're able to locate most of what you need.
There's not much in the way of "wood" available here except as a luxury material,
  so you modify your plans to use light-gauge steel box section instead,
  but you're able to find where to get half-inch steel wire rope and the bits of rigging hardware you need.

All of this is _quite_ expensive though, more than you can afford at the moment,
  but knowing the prices of these things gives you a goal to save for.

Against all odds, you're able to find a collection of survey maps showing parts of the canyon network.
It's somewhat out of date, but it confirms that there really isn't any way to just drive your rover around.

With the map, you're also able to identify a site only about two days hike from the city,
  where the canyon narrows to less than 150 feet between some large rock formations.
It's an ideal location for what you're planning.

Normally, though, for something like this you'd have at least two people,
  one on each side.
Without a second person, you will need to hike across the canyon floor probably six or seven times,
  and won't be possible to do that at the chosen site.
Rather, you'll have to hike nearly a day north of there cross,
  almost to where you left the rover, in order to cross on foot.

On the far side, at least, you'll be able to _use_ the rover to travel along the canyon edge more quickly,
  but at minimum this is going to take nearly fourteen days for something that would take maybe three with another person.
And that's assuming everything works as expected.

At some point you find yourself talking over the problems with your roommates.
Maybe one of them might have a better idea,
  or if nothing else you might be able to get one of them to loan you some cash to help pay for the equipment.
Probably not, but the answer's always no if you don't ask, right?

"Ok, well then, you can teach us how to set it up," Eli states, matter-of-factly.
"That way you don't have to travel back and forth for every step."

"Wait, what?"
It takes you a moment to process her statement.

Before you can respond, Jerry breaks in.
"I know a guy who works on the city domes,
  I can probably get the cable for cheaper than that.
The dome cables apparently all have to be continuous pieces
  and they sometimes have a lot of extra cable the end of a spool that they can't use."

"Woah woah woah, hold up a moment.
I mean, sure, I'd appreciate the help" &mdash; you really would &mdash;
  "but you've done more than enough to help already."

"I ... I'm not sure I understand."
Eli wore an expression you'd learned to interpret as puzzlement,
  shared to various degrees by the other three.
"We're helping you.
All of us, together."

You sigh.

----

After some more work,
  you're able to find an unused area of land not too far from the city
  in which to practice setting up the line,
  and train the four &mdash; now _five_ halflings, actually &mdash;
  how to rig the cable and pulleys.
Here, at least,
  failing just means picking the cable back up off the ground,
  rather than hoping you don't die retrieving it from the canyon floor.

About that.

The newest addition to the party you've nicknamed Coke,
  partially because of the dark brown hair stripe and skin tone,
  but also because the one syllable you'd managed to catch of his real name sounded a bit like "cola".
He'd just appeared one day, and was now apparently part of the team.

One of the others &mdash; you think Jerry &mdash; had gone ahead and just _gotten_ a large spool of cable,
  and he'd either gotten it for free or had paid for it himself without telling you.

These sorts of developments seemed to just happen now, apparently,
  and it was about all you could do to just take it in stride.

Initially you try to resist, but your efforts are at best met with confusion,
  and although you're not great at reading their expressions,
  you think you might have accidently hurt Morgan's feelings at one point by trying.

Just chill. Go with the flow. It seemed headed your way anyway.

It doesn't take much practice with the equipment you've gathered
  before they're able to set up the A-frames and string the cable themselves.

And, more importantly, before you're confident enough to trust them to do it.

All five of them are, of course, coming with you.
It's not even worth trying to dissuade them.

----

At last the rest of your arrangements are in place and you're able to leave with your party of halflings.

The cable and most of the equipment is carried in a small hand-cart that gets traded off periodically,
  and you are able to make good time on the dirt roads extending away from the city.

By disk, you reach the point to turn off from the road,
  and strike camp just in time to avoid the rains.

Another day dawns.
Maneuvering the cart off-road over the rough terrain is slow going,
  but midday finds you at the canyon rim.
This is the point at which you split up.

From here, Morgan and Coke will proceed south with the cart to the site you'd chosen,
  and set up camp to await your arrival on the other side.
  
You, Jerry, Nydia, and Eli will travel north to the point where you'd crossed before.
You distribute the pieces of equipment you'll need on the otherside from the cart for members of the team to carry,
  and unload one of the A-frames.

As you proceed along the rim, you rotate carrying the A-frame between pairs of the crew.
Eventually, you reach the point across from where you'd left the rover, and strike camp early.

You awaken an break camp four hours before dawn, as soon as the sun's binary partner is high enough in the sky to see by.
You'll need as much time as possible to cross the canyon floor before the next nightfall.

The descent goes smoothly, and you reach the canyon floor just as the sky begins to lighten,
  although you won't see sunlight this far down for several hours yet.
The river at the bottom is more full than it was your first time,
  but you're able to find a route across,
  hopping between several large boulders that had come to rest there the night before.

The ascent proves more challenging.
It's not a technically demanding climb,
  but even acclimatized as you are to the low oxygen atmosphere,
  you find yourself panting from exertion,
  and need to rest frequently.

Nydia has much less trouble though,
  and is able to ascend ahead of you to anchor a rope,
  making the climb easier for you.

All things considered, your party makes it up the other side without incident,
  and with nearly four hours of daylight remaining,
  you reach the rover, right where you left it covered in the tarp.

----

Time was kind to the small rover,
  and as you peel back the sediment-covered tarp concealing it you breathe a sigh of relief.
It's still here.

"Wow," you hear Eli comment behind you as you detach the anchors holding the rover firmly in place.
"You weren't kidding."

The batteries are still 60% charged, and a quick check of the throttle causes the tires to spin under it,
  kicking up a bit of dust.

"Alright, looks like it still works!" you declare.

----

It takes a bit of work re-arranging the cargo, but you're able to strap some of it to the side,
  enough to make room for the three halflings to ride with you.

It's slow going,

All of the cargo you'd had on board appears to be intact
- halflings know it's some kind of vehicle
- still very impressed by it
- there's not much room 

eyThe other members of the party seem duly impressed by it
You need as much time as possible to cross the canyon floor to avoid being swept away,

He'd either paid for it himself without telling you or managed to get it for free

halfling clans communicate openly internally, foundation of teamwork
how does the money work? there's a hanndful of cities that have facilities for launching exports to trade.
coin is issued by export cities,
  given as an export token to be able to exchange for goods,
  which you can then use to buy various sorts of goods or equipment from them that the've imported in the past
the tokens get used for general currency

- no way to drive it around the canyon
- vehicles are quite valuable
- outline your plan
- based on my photos there's a point where the canyon narrows
- can string a rope across

You spend the next several hours communicating the issue, and outlining your plan to retrieve your rover and its contents.
Both of them seemed more than willing to help, or at least listen and comment.

With their help, you're able to procure a better map of the canyon network.
You already have some photographs from orbit, but they don't show enough detail concrete plans around.

Fortunately, maps _are_ available, and after some work you're able to find and purchase a suitable survey map of the canyon network.
Odds are the canyon has eroded some since that survey, but it will work for your purposes.

Using the map, you identify a suitable point where the canyon narrows enough to make your concept feasible,
  and assemble a list of everything you'll need.

----

You pull yourself up over the canyon edge, and pant for a moment.
You've acclimatized to the lower oxygen and were able to cross the canyon floor fairly quickly.

As the three other halflings reach the top, you start pulling up the rope attached to the steel A-frame.

Most of the heavy pieces of equipment &mdash; the steel cable, the transfer pulleys, etc. &mdash;
  are at the chosen site on the other side of the canyon,
  but there was but there was no avoiding the need to carry the A-frame and cable anchors across by hand.
You'd left it there with Jerry and Eli;
  Jerry had seemed the most competent with the rigging when you'd practiced the procedure earlier on flat ground.

Unfortunately, there hadn't been anywhere near the chosen site that could be easily crossed.
After dropping off the heavy cable and most of the equipment,
  it took two days to hike to the point where you'd crossed before after abandoning your rover.

Now though, you are across, with Morgan and Nydia, and &mdash;
  assuming it's still there &mdash; only about a hundred yards from the rover.

----

The rover is in nearly as good shape as when you left it, nearly a month ago,
  and with it you're able to make it back to the chosen site well before nightfall.

As you approach the rocky outcrop, you call across the canyon to the other half of your team.
"Ahoy!"
Your voice echoes back from the canyon wall,
  and you spot the A-frame on the other side where you'd anchored it in place.

After a moment, Jerry steps up next to it and hollars back.
"Did you miss us?"

You strike camp for the night.

----

Morning comes, and the winds are favorable.
You assemble a small kite from a thin wire,
  and after a few false starts Nydia manages to fly it far enough across for Eli to catch the string.
The string is used to pull a larger rope, and then that rope is used to pull the steel cable.

The steel cable is strung across the top of both A-frames and anchored firmly into the rock on either side,
  and pulled tight on the far end using a manual winch.
At last, it's in place,
  and you pull on a smaller thin rope. With it comes a large pulley, running on the steel cable, bearing a hook.

Over the next few hours you unload your rover and place the items into nets that you rig to the hook.
The parcels are pulled across to the other side and detached, and the hook pulled back empty.

Eventually, you're left with just the rover.
Rig it to the pulley, pull it across.


  which are pulled across by the crew on the other side and unloaded.


  and at last, you're able to pull on a 



Your plan to fly a small kite across the canyon worked, and 



You camp on the rocky outcrop, signaling to Jerry and Eli that you've made it with a small signal mirror.
Four bright flashes back indicates they got your signal.

Half-inch steel wire rope, 250 feet.
Or the next larger local size, anyway.
Like the language, the units here are a mess, but you have spotted steel cable in use supporting the domes of the city,
  clearly it _is_ available here.

Fortunately, steel wire rope _is_ available here.
You've run the numbers, and while something like nylon would have worked,
  you would have needed a rope over an inch and a half thick.
Half-inch steel cable is much easier to 

You'll still need around 250 feet of half-inch steel cable.

You've run the numbers for other materials, but even if nylon or polyester ropes were available

You'd traced out a more precise map

come up with a plan
continue working this week

aquire a better map of the canyons

one-inch fiber rope, tensile strength 
what kind of rope or cable is available here?

kai's vehicle is a bit under 1 ton empty
crossing with a 10:1 sag, cable load factor is about 2.5, a-frame load factor is about 1.5

there is steel cable available. 9/16 steel cable has safe load of 2.7 tons and weighs .53 lb/ft
nylon rope is available. 1 3/4 nylon is 2.7 tons weighs 0.780 lb/ft

actually, gravity is 'slightly lighter than you're used to' so 0.9 or 0.8?
gives us a bit more room.

rover weighs 0.8 tons, then we only need 2 ton (4000 lb) cable
steel: 1/2 inch is 0.42 lbm/ft
nylon: 1 1/2 inch is 0.57 lbm/ft

steel is lighter than nylon
need 250 ft, that's 105 lbm weighing 84 lbs.
kai will carry the cable

A frames neex to take 2400 lbf, based on calculator can use 3/4x1-1/2 16ga, 0.94 lbm/ft
need 4x6 ft, that's 4x5.64 = 22.56 lbm, weighing 4x4.51 = 18 lbs.

plus winches and chains and the smaller pull cable, sand anchors

all in all about 500 lbs of *stuff*

procure a handcart to carry it all

all travel to the crossing point they'd identified with the heavy stuff

leave all but the necessary shovels, sand anchors, and a-frame with the team

note: this is planned to take 4 days, we'll leave cairns

kai and one other hike back to the point where it's possible to descend and ascend
cross over to other side

have to search for a bit, eventually find the rover
pull up the tarp, partially buried in wet sand

rover is intact, as are the goods

drive to point opposite the rest of the team, signal them

they launch the lead line, you grab it and pull the steel cable across
dig in the sand anchor and set up the A-frame, and attach the steel cable.

signal ready. the line goes taut, they signal ready

pull the pulley up and across the canyon. hook is right there.

note: UV, sunscreen

unload the rover, rig up parcels and tow them across

finally time for the rover itself, hook it up, tow it across.

everything is across

final step: hike back and across?

----

plan is for everyone to cross the canyon, then test things out for real crossing the minor gorge beside

go upriver, to the point where the canyon narrows slightly enough to enable stringing the rope across

then part of team crosses back over to far side
launch thin string across, tow steel cable across, set up the line, get everything across

not putting people across the line, no way

break down the hawser, far side reels it in, kai and nydia 

kai, morgan, jerry; and also nydia, one of the othe two from the work crew

have aquired a better survey map of the canyon network
marked the position of the buggy and also best guess for the pod since they asked
go several miles upstream with the buggy to a point where the span is much shorter

how is stuff transported? pack animals? wagon? palanquin carried betwen two people?


practice how to do it, to make sure they knew what to do
launch rope across the gorge, tow a bigger cable plus another small cable across
both sides set up a-frame footer and dig a sand anchor
signal mirror flash to launching side indicating it's anchored, ready to tension the main cable
use small rope to pull payload attached to pulley across the canyon on the main cable

Similar principle to breeches buoy process. Reference reenactments on youtube.

Party of five: Kai, morgan, jerry, nydia, eli, coke
