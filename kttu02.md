Approach air-supported dome city.

Frontier world settlement, "ketterexcha"
- majority inhabitants are kenders/phascolians
- population: 10,000 adults, across about a thousand different clan/tribe/colony groups
- has several large air-supported domes "wards", harmonic law sizing

Encounter group laboring in a field, hail them.
- your words repeated back at you
- don't share a language with them, of course
- you are about 50% taller and generally larger than them
- able to communicate graphically - draw orbit, reentry

Approach work gang in field.
Hail them.
One who seems a kind of leader hails you back, and goes back to working.

Pantomime the work action, point at self.

Harvesting tubers from the field.

Work gang eventually slows, and they all break for lunch.

You eat a ration bar. Making idle conversation even though don't understand.
Kender have already gained several linguistics points in English just from the brief dialogue.

"These things must be good eating, seein' as you're growing em everywhere it seems."

foreman: "Eat?" made affirmative hand gesture. "good good eat!"

pulls a tuber from the wheelbarrow, hands it to him

"good eat!"

crew is watching you

puzzled for a moment, then foreman pantomimes biting it

"sure, if you're offering" you bite in and about to spit it out

glance around, crew is lol-ing.
realizing this is a joke at your expense, decide to play along

nod, "good eat! you want?" you hand it back enthusiastically, pressing it on him

rest of crew lols even harder and he reluctantly takes it back
like he's now expected to take a bite too

you can't help yourself, and finally spit out the bit of tuber, gagging in the midst of both the crew's and your own laughter.
take a swig from your canteen to try to wash out the nasty flavor, swishing it around and spitting on the ground

"very good eat!" you grin at him, and after a moment he joins laughing

clearly all in good fun, and this had broken the ice.

Conversing in their alien dialect, and some efforts at conversing with him.

"Could probably use a little salt though. Although I guess it needs to be cooked first or something."

Discussion started up, the crew chatting about something-or-other.

Tried to follow along, although difficult pronounciations - you suppose you're probably going to have to learn the language.

still got caught up in the general flow of conversation.
"What's the word for these anyway?" you ask.
hold up the root, don't expect them to understand or answer.

get response "{complex xeno word}"

tried not to mangle the pronounciation, repeating it and pointing at the root.

foreman repeats his simplified pronounciation and nodded. apparently that was good enough for them.

foreman introduces himself, points at self and says what could be assumed was his name
go around, get names

tried to remember them, but brain not geared for these xeno pronounciations

points at him

"me?". you point to yourself, "kai"

"small word for big {stranger}"

eventually things die down, and kenders start standing back up

"how many more hours until you guys usually knock off for the day?"

kender cocks head

understood from context

spouting xeno jabber then stops

"kai here", points down then up in the sky.
"work here", sweeps arm from there to where the sun shone in the sky

ok, clearly indicating the time by the position of the sun
swept further, then pointed toward the domes "go here"

Two more hours.
easy

returned to the field with the crew

----

two hours passed 

f: "where is kai go"

k: strange, choppy. "with you, to the city"

f: frown, "I mean, where is kai, go ... go _before_?"

k: "where am I from? I'm from Earth."
you point in the general direction in the sky.
memories of all you'd been forced to leave behind.

f: "earth has ... big?" indicated your large size, somewhat generally

k: yeah, earth has lots of humans. sigh. Perhaps too many, some say.

----

get to entrance to dome with the cartload of roots

guards stop your group at the gate

Interrogating foreman about kai. lots of pointing and aggressive gesticulation.
Also, they're speaking an entirely different language.

guards argue that kai is big and dangerous and should be excluded
foreman says he works hard

f: "not all work big here either"
f: "the ..." motined at guard, and kai completes, "guard?"
f: guard wants (kai's valuable item)
f: "now, then he give {passport}"
f: spat, "not his to say"

k: doesn't want to give up the valuable
k: all too familiar with the concept of corruption
k: seems a small price to pay to avoid coming into conflict with the authorities this early on
k: "It's ok, I'm fine with that."
takes off necklace, and hands it to the greedy-looking guard

do all work big on earth, like kai?

no.

foreman shook his head.
before, they say, everyone work big here.
if you work big, eat good.
no good anywhere.

kai gets paid some shekels - a handful of _computer chips_ - from Earth, of all places
heard that human-made electronics were considered extremely valuable off of Earth,
  but hadn't realized that might extend to using them as currency.
None of the other workers were getting paid here.

Four SIM cards and an SD card.

----

kai becomes a Tech Support Wizard.

Travels back to his vehicle, drove back to the capsule, excavated it from mud.
Strip down all the electronics inside, found a massive socketed CPU.
