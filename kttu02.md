You hike along the now gravel road, approaching closer to the domes of the settlement ahead,
  when you first encounter them.
A group of small humanoids that look to be around four feet tall,
  laboring in one of the fields along the road.

Their skin color varies, some what tan but easily within the range of human skin colors,
  and they wear fabric cover-alls, long-sleeved shirts, and gloves to protect themselves.

They even have hair on their heads, of a sort,
  although as you get closer it looks more like long stringy feathers than your own hair.
Several of them have a colorful stripe down the middle.

As you pass, one of them waves and hails you in an alien tonge,
  calling in a seemingly-friendly way.

This work crew is harvesting the tubers you saw earlier,
  twisting to uproot them, cutting off and discarding the leafy tops.
The cut tubers are stacked in piles before being loaded onto a small trailer behind a suitably-sized tractor.

No reason to be unfriendly back.
In fact, as you wave in response, you realize this could be the perfect opportunity.

You set down your pack and retrieve your knife,
  then step into the field,
  immitating the process you just saw performed.
With your size, you're able to pull up the tubers easily,
  and after a moment you've managed to uproot and decapitate a half-dozen of them.

The worker loading the stacks into the trailer has paused to look at you,
  uncertain of your intent,
  and you carry the six you've harvested over to stack them in the trailer yourself.
You could easily carry more than six, but this helps clarify your intent.
Nothing like a bit of free labor to help put any fear at ease.

As you work, you do occasionally see one of the others watching you.
Perhaps they're simply puzzled by the strange hulking giant that randomly showed up and decided to help,
  although you like to think they're impressed with your strength and speed,
  as the stacks of tubers beside you grow.

Eventually, as the sun reaches its zenith,
  one of the workers &mdash; possibly the crew's foreman &mdash;
  calls a break.

The dozen or so laborers congregate by the trailer,
  sitting on stacks of tubers that have yet to be loaded,
  and pass around canteens of water.

You retrieve one of your canteens from where you left your bag,
  and drink thirstily,
  before pulling out one of your ration bars.

The foreman calls over to you, again in a language you don't understand,
  but it's clear he's invited you to join them by the trailer,
  and you do.

Many of the crew are clearly nervous with your presence, though,
  and make only minimal conversation among themselves.
They all appear to be eating some sort of flatbread,
  and you munch on your ration bar in silence.

Eventually, you break the silence.

"These things must be good eating.
Seein' as you're growing them everywhere it seems," you say,
  indicating the stacked tubers.

"Eating?" the foreman asks, with a slight tilt of the head,
  and made an affirmative-looking hand gesture.
"Good, good eating!" He picks up a tuber and hands it to you,
  and you accept it, not sure what else to do.

"Good eating!" he says again, with emphasis, and after a moment pantomimes taking a bite out of it.

The rest of the crew is watching, and so you take a bite.

Immediately gag from the taste.
The raw tuber is incredibly bitter.

But as you look around, the crew seems to find this ... _funny_.
Was this intended as a joke?

You decide to take it that way,
  and so rather than immediately spitting it out,
  you force yourself to grin.

"Good, good eating! You want?"
He offered it back to the foreman.
The crew's gaze turned to him, and he accepted it reluctantly, like he was being pressured into it.

The foreman eyed the tuber nervously.

_This_ was _a joke._

At that moment you couldn't hold it any more, and spat out the chunk of the tuber,
  coughing and laughing.
The rest of the crew followed, making a sound that must be analagous to it.

"Good eating!" you state again, emphatically,
  before rinsing your mouth out with water from your canteen
  and spitting out onto the ground.

Clearly, this was all meant in good fun, and the foreman joins the laughter,
  clearly relieved he won't be forced to take a bite himself.

In that moment, the ice was broken, and conversation could flow freely.
You don't understand most of their words,
  but you don't need to to understand that you'd been judged and found worthy.
You just follow along as best you can &mdash; you'll need to learn the local language eventually &mdash;
  and comment in your own language as it seems appropriate.

"What's the word for these tuber things anyway?" you find yourself asking,
  holding the one you'd bitten almost as a trophy.

"Word? _tsutssupkan_," replies the workman beside you,
  and points at another of the tubers,
  to ensure you understand that he's giving the name for this root in case he misunderstood the question.

He pronounces the word with a particular emphasis on the _ss_ and a very subtle _k_ sound that you're not quite sure you can reproduce,
  but you nod, confirming that that was what you had asked, and try your best anyway to say it back.

"Tsoo-tsoop-kan," you say.

"Tsutssupkan." He nods back, and this time pronounces it the way you did.

He pauses for a moment, then asks, "word for ... you?"

"Kai. My name is Kai." You point to yourself.

"Small word, for big ..." he motions at you, indicating your large relative size.

"I guess so," you say. "So what's your name?"

----

You nod, confirming that that was what you had asked.

The workman next to you points to He pointed at another of the tubers, indicating this was their name for it, adn 

Eventually, the conversation slowed, you finished your ration bar,
  and they finished the unusual-looking pieces of flatbread they'd pulled out.

"Could probably use a little salt though. Although I guess it needs to be cooked first or something."

Discussion started up, the crew chatting about something-or-other.

Tried to follow along, although difficult pronounciations - you suppose you're probably going to have to learn the language.

still got caught up in the general flow of conversation.
"What's the word for these anyway?" you ask.
hold up the root, don't expect them to understand or answer.

get response "{complex xeno word}"

tried not to mangle the pronounciation, repeating it and pointing at the root.

foreman repeats his simplified pronounciation and nodded. apparently that was good enough for them.

foreman introduces himself, points at self and says what could be assumed was his name
go around, get names

tried to remember them, but brain not geared for these xeno pronounciations

points at him

"me?". you point to yourself, "kai"

"small word for big {stranger}"

eventually things die down, and kenders start standing back up

"how many more hours until you guys usually knock off for the day?"

kender cocks head

understood from context

spouting xeno jabber then stops

"kai here", points down then up in the sky.
"work here", sweeps arm from there to where the sun shone in the sky

ok, clearly indicating the time by the position of the sun
swept further, then pointed toward the domes "go here"

Two more hours.
easy

returned to the field with the crew

----

two hours passed 

f: "where is kai go"

k: strange, choppy. "with you, to the city"

f: frown, "I mean, where is kai, go ... go _before_?"

k: "where am I from? I'm from Earth."
you point in the general direction in the sky.
memories of all you'd been forced to leave behind.

f: "earth has ... big?" indicated your large size, somewhat generally

k: yeah, earth has lots of humans. sigh. Perhaps too many, some say.

get to entrance to dome with the cartload of roots

guards stop your group at the gate

Interrogating foreman about kai. lots of pointing and aggressive gesticulation.
Also, they're speaking an entirely different language.

guards argue that kai is big and dangerous and should be excluded
foreman says he works hard

f: "not all work big here either"
f: "the ..." motined at guard, and kai completes, "guard?"
f: guard wants (kai's valuable item)
f: "now, then he give {passport}"
f: spat, "not his to say"

k: doesn't want to give up the valuable
k: all too familiar with the concept of corruption
k: seems a small price to pay to avoid coming into conflict with the authorities this early on
k: "It's ok, I'm fine with that."
takes off necklace, and hands it to the greedy-looking guard

guard gives kai an official-looking pass thinger

f: "do all work big on earth, like kai?"

no.

foreman shook his head.
before, they say, everyone work big here.
if you work big, eat good.
no good anywhere.

kai gets paid some shekels - a handful of _computer chips_ - from Earth, of all places
heard that human-made electronics were considered extremely valuable off of Earth,
  but hadn't realized that might extend to using them as currency.
None of the other workers were getting paid here.

A handful of SIM cards, some of which had been clipped in half like pieces of eight.

small communes of around 20 adults of both sexes

He spent most of the day working in the fields with this crew.




spoken languages were apparently very fluid for kender.

It was often said on Earth that English was really three languages in a trenchcoat, robbed other languages in dark alleys and going through their pockets for loose grammar.

If that was the case, the ... _languages_, if the term really even still applied,
  that these kenders spoke was some kind of unholy abomination that had been pulled directly from some primordial soup of elemental chaos.

Across even _this_ small settlement of about ten thousand people,
  there wasn't just _one_ common language, or even _two_.
There were literally _thousands_ of distinct dialects and languages,
  all bleeding into each other in a horible convoluted mess.

As far as can tell, there _were_ a relatively small number of common-ish pidgin languages &mdash; maybe a half-dozen &mdash;
  but these were really only ever used when starting a conversation with a stranger,
  and in real conversation would rapidly evolve into some kind of ad-hoc 'best common subset' language common to its participants.

On the plus side,
  he'd managed to get a handle on the most common pidgin 'greeting language' used here,
  and he was able to conduct most business using a mix of _English_ with this pidgin,
  using grammar and vocabulary many of the kenders had somehow just _picked up_ interacting with him.
But at the same time,
  by using that greeting language he was basically greeting everyone as a stranger all the time &mdash;
  making him a sort of permanent foreigner &mdash;
  and the lack of 'linguistic reciprocity' in these exchanges
  generally gave the impression that he was somewhat dim-witted or perhaps childish.

Dammit, you _tried_.
Your brain just wasn't built for this kind of thing.
Still, when one of them introduced one of their own terms to a conversation,
  you did your best to _try_ to remember and use it, at least for that conversation;
  show you were at least _trying_ to reciprocate.

the roots are indeed mashed and washed to separate out the starch.

This was used to make a slightly-sour-tasting flatbread that formed the main staple of their diet.

Occasionally it would be served with communal dishes of various fillings that you used the flatbread to pick up and then ate with it,
  but this was something of a luxury at least among the lower classes;
  these fillings were to provide variety, not to fill you up, and often the bread was just served plain.
  
Unfortunately many of the spices they often used in cooking weren't really edible for him,
  tasting at best kind of funny and at worst downright acrid.

There were a handful he could stomach - some kind of greens with a mild citrus-y flavor,
  and this other sweet potato analogue that was mildly spicy,
  needed to start growing his own crops.

kai made it into a wrap
  
  or used to make a kind of wrap with fillings inside it,
  
It was sometimes served with fillings, which were grabbed with a piece of flatbread
better than nutrient bars though
