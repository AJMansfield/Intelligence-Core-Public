Approach air-supported dome city.

Frontier world settlement, "ketterexcha"
- majority inhabitants are kenders/phascolians
- population: 10,000 adults, across about a thousand different clan/tribe/colony groups
- has several large air-supported domes "wards", harmonic law sizing

Encounter group laboring in a field, hail them.
- your words repeated back at you
- don't share a language with them, of course
- you are about 50% taller and generally larger than them
- able to communicate graphically - draw orbit, reentry

Approach work gang in field.
Hail them.
One who seems a kind of leader hails you back, and goes back to working.

Pantomime the work action, point at self.

Harvesting tubers from the field.

Work gang eventually slows, and they all break for lunch.

You eat a ration bar. Making idle conversation even though don't understand.
Kender have already gained several linguistics points in English just from the brief dialogue.

"These things must be good eating, seein' as you're growing em everywhere it seems."

foreman: "Eat?" made affirmative hand gesture. "good good eat!"

pulls a tuber from the wheelbarrow, hands it to him

"good eat!"

crew is watching you

puzzled for a moment, then foreman pantomimes biting it

"sure, if you're offering" you bite in and about to spit it out

glance around, crew is lol-ing.
realizing this is a joke at your expense, decide to play along

nod, "good eat! you want?" you hand it back enthusiastically, pressing it on him

rest of crew lols even harder and he reluctantly takes it back
like he's now expected to take a bite too

you can't help yourself, and finally spit out the bit of tuber, gagging in the midst of both the crew's and your own laughter.
take a swig from your canteen to try to wash out the nasty flavor, swishing it around and spitting on the ground

"very good eat!" you grin at him, and after a moment he joins laughing

clearly all in good fun, and this had broken the ice.

Conversing in their alien dialect, and some efforts at conversing with him.

"Could probably use a little salt though. Although I guess it needs to be cooked first or something."

Discussion started up, the crew chatting about something-or-other.

Tried to follow along, although difficult pronounciations - you suppose you're probably going to have to learn the language.

still got caught up in the general flow of conversation.
"What's the word for these anyway?" you ask.
hold up the root, don't expect them to understand or answer.

get response "{complex xeno word}"

tried not to mangle the pronounciation, repeating it and pointing at the root.

foreman repeats his simplified pronounciation and nodded. apparently that was good enough for them.

foreman introduces himself, points at self and says what could be assumed was his name
go around, get names

tried to remember them, but brain not geared for these xeno pronounciations

points at him

"me?". you point to yourself, "kai"

"small word for big {stranger}"

eventually things die down, and kenders start standing back up

"how many more hours until you guys usually knock off for the day?"

kender cocks head

understood from context

spouting xeno jabber then stops

"kai here", points down then up in the sky.
"work here", sweeps arm from there to where the sun shone in the sky

ok, clearly indicating the time by the position of the sun
swept further, then pointed toward the domes "go here"

Two more hours.
easy

returned to the field with the crew

----

two hours passed 

f: "where is kai go"

k: strange, choppy. "with you, to the city"

f: frown, "I mean, where is kai, go ... go _before_?"

k: "where am I from? I'm from Earth."
you point in the general direction in the sky.
memories of all you'd been forced to leave behind.

f: "earth has ... big?" indicated your large size, somewhat generally

k: yeah, earth has lots of humans. sigh. Perhaps too many, some say.

----

get to entrance to dome with the cartload of roots

guards stop your group at the gate

Interrogating foreman about kai. lots of pointing and aggressive gesticulation.
Also, they're speaking an entirely different language.

guards argue that kai is big and dangerous and should be excluded
foreman says he works hard

f: "not all work big here either"
f: "the ..." motined at guard, and kai completes, "guard?"
f: guard wants (kai's valuable item)
f: "now, then he give {passport}"
f: spat, "not his to say"

k: doesn't want to give up the valuable
k: all too familiar with the concept of corruption
k: seems a small price to pay to avoid coming into conflict with the authorities this early on
k: "It's ok, I'm fine with that."
takes off necklace, and hands it to the greedy-looking guard

guard gives kai an official-looking pass thinger

f: "do all work big on earth, like kai?"

no.

foreman shook his head.
before, they say, everyone work big here.
if you work big, eat good.
no good anywhere.

kai gets paid some shekels - a handful of _computer chips_ - from Earth, of all places
heard that human-made electronics were considered extremely valuable off of Earth,
  but hadn't realized that might extend to using them as currency.
None of the other workers were getting paid here.

A handful of SIM cards, some of which had been clipped in half like pieces of eight.

do you know where I can stay?

----

Work crew offered him a place to stay for a few days, while he got his bearings in the city.
He spent most of the day working in the fields with this crew.

spoken languages were apparently very fluid for kender.

It was often said on Earth that English was really three languages in a trenchcoat, robbed other languages in dark alleys and going through their pockets for loose grammar.

If that was the case, the ... _languages_, if the term really even still applied,
  that these kenders spoke was some kind of unholy abomination that had been pulled directly from some primordial soup of elemental chaos.

Across even _this_ small settlement of about ten thousand people,
  there wasn't just _one_ common language, or even _two_.
There were literally _thousands_ of distinct dialects and languages,
  all bleeding into each other in a horible convoluted mess.

As far as can tell, there _were_ a relatively small number of common-ish pidgin languages &mdash; maybe a half-dozen &mdash;
  but these were really only ever used when starting a conversation with a stranger,
  and in real conversation would rapidly evolve into some kind of ad-hoc 'best common subset' language common to its participants.

On the plus side,
  he'd managed to get a handle on the most common pidgin 'greeting language' used here,
  and he was able to conduct most business using a mix of _English_ with this pidgin,
  using grammar and vocabulary many of the kenders had somehow just _picked up_ interacting with him.
But at the same time,
  by using that greeting language he was basically greeting everyone as a stranger all the time &mdash;
  making him a sort of permanent foreigner &mdash;
  and the lack of 'linguistic reciprocity' in these exchanges
  generally lead to a general impression that he was somewhat dim-witted or perhaps childish.

Dammit, you _tried_.
Your brain just wasn't built for this kind of thing.
Still, when one of them introduced one of their own terms to a conversation,
  you did your best to _try_ to remember and use it, at least for that conversation;
  show you were at least _trying_ to reciprocate.

Their writing system, at least, was consistent.

But inferring the context of his 
  made it hard for him,
  and gave reputation of being somewhat dim-witted or childish.
  
  
  but using it all the time made him a kind of 'permanent stranger' to everyone,
  marking him as a foreigner.

  they were more than willing to use whatever english they'd somehow managed to pick up just from context talking to him and presumably other kenders who'd themselves picked up a bit of english

And, oddly enough, as he gotten around, that common subset often included English words.

There were a handful of 
  aside from a kind of pidgin language mostly used in a sort of 'language negotiaton' process - 

Each individual clan seemed to use its own separate dialect or language within the clan,
  but there wasn't really any common pidgin languages, rather, conversations between members of different clans seemed to just use a random mish-mash of the two
He'd made some progress and had gotten a grasp on a kind of common pidgin language.
  
  this was rarely used for full conversations

a kind of common subset that most of the cities inhabitant's would understand,
  can ask for basic things.
But while conversations between total strangers would often start out in this common pidgin dialect,
  they'd quickly negotiate and move into using more complex 'common dialect'.

While the intersection between everyone could be summarized in this small pidgin dialect,
  any two people would 

Most conversations between strangers usually started with this,

tries to learn to speak their language, but they were learning to speak English themselves, very rapidly.
the roots are indeed mashed and washed to separate out the starch.

This was used to make a slightly-sour-tasting flatbread that formed the main staple of their diet.

Occasionally it would be served with communal dishes of various fillings that you used the flatbread to pick up and then ate with it,
  but this was something of a luxury at least among the lower classes;
  these fillings were to provide variety, not to fill you up, and often the bread was just served plain.
  
Unfortunately many of the spices they often used in cooking weren't really edible for him,
  tasting at best kind of funny and at worst downright acrid.

There were a handful he could stomach - some kind of greens with a mild citrus-y flavor,
  and this other sweet potato analogue that was mildly spicy,
  needed to start growing his own crops.


kai made it into a wrap
  
  or used to make a kind of wrap with fillings inside it,
  
It was sometimes served with fillings, which were grabbed with a piece of flatbread
better than nutrient bars though

kai becomes a Tech Support Wizard.

Travels back to his vehicle, drove back to the capsule, excavated it from mud.
Strip down all the electronics inside, found a massive socketed CPU.

Portents say: "press OK to continue"
this is a grave portent indeed.

convert them all to linux?

blessed a baby - write random english words in sharpie on their forehead
