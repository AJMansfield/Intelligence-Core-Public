----

You hike along the now gravel road, approaching closer to the domes of the settlement ahead,
  when you first encounter them.
A group of small humanoids that look to be around four feet tall,
  laboring in one of the fields along the road.

Their skin color varies, some what tan but easily within the range of human skin colors,
  and they wear fabric cover-alls, long-sleeved shirts, and gloves to protect themselves.

They even have hair on their heads, of a sort,
  although as you get closer it looks more like long stringy feathers than your own hair.
Several of them have a colorful stripe down the middle.

As you pass, one of them waves and hails you in an alien tonge,
  calling in a seemingly-friendly way.

This work crew is harvesting the tubers you saw earlier,
  twisting to uproot them, cutting off and discarding the leafy tops.
The cut tubers are stacked in piles before being loaded onto a small trailer behind a suitably-sized tractor.

No reason to be unfriendly back.
In fact, as you wave in response, you realize this could be the perfect opportunity.

You set down your pack and retrieve your knife,
  then step into the field,
  immitating the process you just saw performed.
With your size, you're able to pull up the tubers easily,
  and after a moment you've managed to uproot and decapitate a half-dozen of them.

The worker loading the stacks into the trailer has paused to look at you,
  uncertain of your intent,
  and you carry the six you've harvested over to stack them in the trailer yourself.
You could easily carry more than six, but this helps clarify your intent.
Nothing like a bit of free labor to help put any fear at ease.

Despite your size, this is still hard work.
You've been able to adjusted some to the lower oxygen atmosphere,
  but you still occasionally gasp for air,
  and sweat drips down your back.

As you work, you do occasionally see one of the others watching you.
Perhaps they're simply puzzled by the strange hulking giant that randomly showed up and decided to help,
  although you like to think they're impressed with your strength and speed,
  as the stacks of tubers beside you grow.

Eventually, the sun reaches its zenith,
  and one of the workers &mdash; possibly the crew's foreman &mdash;
  calls a break.

The twenty or so laborers congregate by the trailer,
  sitting on stacks of tubers that have yet to be loaded,
  and pass around canteens of water.

You retrieve one of your canteens from where you left your bag,
  and drink thirstily,
  before pulling out one of your ration bars.

The foreman calls over to you, again in a language you don't understand,
  but it's clear he's invited you to join them by the trailer,
  and you do.

Many of the crew are clearly nervous with your presence, though,
  and make only minimal conversation among themselves.
They all appear to be eating some sort of flatbread,
  and you munch on your ration bar in silence.

Eventually, you break the silence.

"These things must be good eating.
Seein' as you're growing them everywhere it seems," you say,
  indicating the stacked tubers.

"Eating?" the foreman asks, with a slight tilt of the head,
  and made an affirmative-looking hand gesture.
"Good, good eating!" He picks up a tuber and hands it to you,
  and you accept it, not sure what else to do.

"Good eating!" he says again, with emphasis, and after a moment pantomimes taking a bite out of it.

The rest of the crew is watching, and so you take a bite.

You immediately retch from the taste.
The raw tuber is incredibly bitter.

But as you look around, the crew seems to find this ... _funny_.
Was this some sort of practical joke, played at his expense?

You decide to take it that way,
  and so rather than immediately spitting it out,
  you force yourself to grin.

"Good, good eating! You want some?"
He offered it back to the foreman.
The crew's gaze turned to him, and he accepted it reluctantly, as if they were all now pressuring _him_ into it.

The foreman eyed the tuber nervously.

This _was_ meant as a joke.

At that moment you couldn't hold it any more, and spat out the chunk of the tuber,
  coughing and laughing.
The rest of the crew followed, making a sound that was fairly analagous.

"Good eating!" you state again, emphatically,
  before rinsing your mouth out with water from your canteen
  and spitting out onto the ground.

Clearly, this was all meant in good fun, and the foreman joins the laughter,
  relieved he won't be forced to take a bite himself.
Even for them, these tubers require processing to be edible.

In that moment, the ice breaks, and conversation flows freely.
You don't understand most of their words,
  but you don't need to to understand that you'd been judged and found worthy.
You just follow along as best you can &mdash; you'll need to learn the local language eventually &mdash;
  and comment in your own language as it seems appropriate.

"What's the word for these tuber things anyway?" you find yourself asking,
  holding the one you'd bitten almost as a trophy.

"Word? _tsutssupkan_," replies the workman beside you,
  and points at another of the tubers,
  to ensure you understand that he's giving the name for this root in case he misunderstood the question.

He pronounces the word with a particular emphasis on the _ss_ and a very subtle _k_ sound that you're not quite sure you can reproduce,
  but you nod, confirming that that was what you had asked, and try your best anyway to say it back.

"Tsoo-tsoop-kan," you say.

"Tsutssupkan." He nods back, and this time pronounces it the way you did.

He pauses for a moment, then asks, "word for ... you?"

"Kai. My name is Kai." You point to yourself.

"Small word, for big ..." he motions at you, indicating your large relative size.

"I guess so," you say. "So what's your name?"

----

You work alongside the ... what were you going to refer to them as?

They'd identified as '_Ksip-pukt-sim-nmi_' or something like that,
  using some subtle alien pronounciations that your human mouth couldn't quite articulate,
  but you had a sense that this was a name for just this particular group,
  and you hadn't quite been able to communicate desire to know their name for the species as a whole.

Anyway, you work alongside the halflings for several more hours,
  until finally the field is harvested.
The trailer is stacked full of the tubers,
  and you retrieve your pack to follow the crew as they walk behind it to the city up ahead.

As you walk, the foreman &mdash; who'd identified as '_Ye-o-ne-e_' and who'd accepted your nickname 'Leon',
  poses a question to you.
"Where was Kai go?"

"I don't really have anywhere. I guess, with you? To the city?"
You gesticulate to illustrate your meaning as best you can.

You'd expected to have to learn the local language,
  but the fact they were willing &mdash; and for that matter _able_ &mdash; to learn yours,
  _this_ rapidly, had been a surprise.

He frowns for a moment before attempting to clarify.
"I mean, where was Kai go .. go _before_?"

You sigh, memories you'd rather forget returning, of your old life on Earth.
"I come from a long, _long_ way from here."

"From ... up?" He indicates the sky.

You suppose that's accurate.

"Many of us, too, come from up, before here."

----

Finally, you approach the entrance to the city.
In addition to the large domes you'd seen from afar,
  there are many smaller domes scattered around,
  some seemingly isolated, others connected by small tunnels.

There's also other, smaller outbuildings, not covered by any dome,
  and you see trickles of both foot and vehicular traffic move in and out of a squat building at the edge of the dome,
  large roll doors opening and closing with each wave.

Your theory that these were air-supported domes appears to have been correct.

All the people you see are of the same halfling species as the group you follow,
  although there's significant color variation,
  skin tones ranging from deep oranges and pale tans to burnt reds and dark browns.

Although, as you look again,
  beneath the grime your group itself has quite a bit of variation, even just between its own members.

You follow the group into one of the smaller entrance buildings.
The trailer is rolled onto a truck scale and unhitched from the tractor,
  and the rest of the group stands around as Leon speaks to some kind of uniformed official stationed here.

The language they're speaking is very different from the one the crew had used among themselves earlier,
  although there were _some_ similarities.
You pick out the word _tsutssupkan_ again,
  but you almost miss it; pronounciation was _quite_ different from the version you'd learned.

After a moment though, the conversation starts becoming more heated.
Both of them are gesticulating towards you, and you hear your name used.

Leon breaks off and stalks back,
  wearing an expression you interpret as frustration.

"The ... " he gesticulates, and you fill in.

"Guard?"

"The guard, he wants ..."
He indicates the ring you wear on your finger.
"Or not give ... not let you in."

The meaning was clear.
The guard &mdash; probably more customs official &mdash;
  expected a bribe, in exchange for some kind of ID card or token you'd need to be allowed in the city.

As much as the memory associated with that ring pains you,
  it still wasn't one you wished to give up.

"Is there anything else I can give him?" you ask,
  as you try to figure out what else you had that they might be willing to accept.

Several other members of the crew obviously didn't like this eather,
  and one of them spat on the floor.
"Not his to say."

Your mental search comes up empty.
And you can't exactly afford coming into conflict with the authorities this early on.

The crew seems to be getting agitated,
  and another uniformed halfling tightens their grip on what was most definitely a halfling-sized assault rifle.

This wasn't worth getting into trouble over.
You put up your hand, and slip the ring off.

"It's ok, I'll pay the bribe," you say.

You hand the ring over, and the official slips it into a small pouch at his waist.
He hands you an official-looking form covered in alien heiroglyphics.

Leon sees your confusion, and waves the rest of the crew ahead,
  taking the form from you and filling out most of it before sliding it back.

"How you ..." he pantomimes moving his pen.

"Write?"

"Write." He nods. He points to one of the remaining boxes, and then to another.
"How you write name of Kai, and how you write where you're from."

He hands you the pen.

You're no judge of alien writing, but Leon's is incredibly neat and tidy,
  in perfect vertical columns with straight lines and precise circles.
If it weren't for the small dots of ink at the beginning and end of each stroke and the impressions in the page,
  you might have thought it typewritten.

The first two fields make sense at least,
  and you write out 'K-A-I' as neatly as you can in block letters,
  then 'E-A-R-T-H'.

Leon looks over the form,
  then hands it to the official.

The official pulls out a white plastic disc the size of a half-dollar coin,
  covered on one side with some kind of colorful geometric seal.
He flips it over, and writes something on the other side,
  then hands it to you,
  saying something that you take to mean "don't cause any trouble."

You nod. You don't want any trouble.
You also definitely don't want to lose it.
You use the small hole at the disc's perimeter to thread it onto a lanyard.

At last, you're able to exit the gatehouse, and enter the city proper.

----

You spend most of your first week in the city adjusting to the city's norms.

Probably the most striking difference is that these halflings don't seem to form nuclear families the way humans do,
  but rather live in larger clans of usually somewhere from fifteen to thirty older adults.

The _Ksippuktsimnmi_ clan you've fallen in with seems to have around twenty members,
  most of which you met working in the field the first day,
  and about two thirds which you've learned are actually female.

To your eyes about the only difference you can make out is that it's _usually_ men
  who have a colored stripe in the middle of their head hair,
  although that doesn't seem to be a hard-and-fast rule.

However, aside from the clan members, four of the younger halflings on the crew are apparently in a different category.
They, and you, aren't really considered part of the clan,
  but more like hired help.

About twenty percent of this city's population seems to consist of this younger migrant worker class,
  and most of them live in a separate area of the city away from the _Ksippuktsimnmi_ clan building.

For the moment, you stay with two of the migrants, who you manage to coerce the nicknames "Jerry" and "Morgan" from.
The two of them share a very small apartment in the migrant district,
  and with a third occupant of your size it feels rather crowded,
  but you make do, and are grateful for it.

Apparently unemployment and homelessness are common among this population,
  and you often passed alleyways in the migrant districts containing lean-tos and make-shift shelters.

Crime, though, &mdash; aside from petty corruption &mdash;
  seemed to be nearly nonexistant,
  likely due to the city government's brutal justice system.

If one were arrested and convicted of a crime, the only possible outcome was execution.

For some crimes at least,
  it seemed you could opt for immediate summary exile from the city rather than contesting any accusation,
  but even then, criminals were usually given a brand indicating the crime they were accused of.
And on _this_ unforgiving planet,
  depending on the time of year that might not be _better_ than execution, just slower.

You do your best to stay out of trouble.

One thing you do have significant trouble with is the language.

It was often said on Earth that the English language was really three languages stacked on top of each other wearing a trench coat.
That it regularly pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary.

If that was the case, the ... _languages_, if that was even the right term for what these halflings spoke,
  was some kind of eldrich abomination wrested from the elemental chaos and given flesh.

Across even _this_ small city,
  there wasn't just _one_ language, or even a dozen.
There were literally _thousands_ of distinct languages and dialects, in _regular use_,
  all bleeding into each other in a horible convoluted mess.

At least within a single clan,
  there are usually one or two reasonably-consistent languages or dialects used within the clan for _most_ purposes.

And, as far as you can tell, there _are_ a half-dozen pidgin 'greeting languages' that most people in the city know.

But, these are basically only ever used when initiating conversation with a total stranger,
  or as a starting point for when two speakers weren't sure what else they had in common.

Yes, _starting point_.

Interactions between strangers might _start_ in one of these 'greeting languages',
  but by the end of the conversation it will have morphed into a kind of ad-hoc 'best common subset' language,
  one that might possibly be _unique_ to _that specific interaction_.

It was a blessing, then, that nobody really cares if you speak any of it _correctly_.
And those you frequently interact with are also, most of the time, _perfectly willing_ to use
  whatever English they'd _somehow_ managed to just _pick up_ by interacting with you.

All things considered,
  you'd done a remarkable job getting a handle on the most-commonly-used pidgin language and some key local vocabulary.
You can even make yourself understood,
  most of the time.

But the fact you can only really speak that minimal pidgin subset
  marks you as a foreigner in a way that even your large relative size doesn't.
And the lack of a sort of 'linguistic reciprocity' in most of your exchanges
  generally leaves others with the impression that you're somewhat dim-witted or perhaps childish.

Dammit, you _try_.
When someone introduces one of their own terms in a conversation,
  you do your best to try to infer the meaning and remember it, at least for that conversation.
It at least shows you're _trying_ to reciprocate;
  'dim-witted' is certainly a step up from 'intentionally rude'.

Your brain just isn't _built_ to handle this sort of linguistic insanity.

----

It's the end of the halfling work-week,
  and you sit beside the other hired workers at at a table outside the _Ksippuktsimnmi_ clan hall,
  putting away the soft, slightly spongy flatbread that forms their main dietary staple.

The bread is made largely from refined _tsutssupkan_ starch,
  and isn't incredibly flavorful,
  but it is filling, and today there's an unusually large assortment of other dishes along with it.
There are no utensils; 
  you simply use a piece of flatbread to scoop or grab some filling directly from the communal dishes,
  and then eat it and the flatbread together.

This is something of a luxury, at least among poorer clans in the city like _Ksippuktsimnmi_.
Most of the time the bread is simply eaten plain,
  with a minimal amount of other food simply for nutrition and variety.
Today though, there is more than enough even for you,
  and you don't have to worry about recieving reproachful looks for eating too much.

Many of their spices and flavorings aren't really edible for you, unfortunately.
None of it actually smells unpleasant, and mostly the inedible spices simply taste kinda bitter,
  but you steer clear of anything that's even remotely yellow, 
  still remembering the acrid taste from two nights ago.

But salt, fat, sugar, and acid are universal.
The leafy green things with the mild citrus-y flavor are pleasant enough,
  as are what looks like some sort of stewed melon-y gourd thing,
  and the greasy gelatin noodle thing.

You really need to start growing some of your own crops.
While you're able to get enough calories, your vitamin tablets are going to last you only so long.

Your thoughts turn to the rover you left at the far side of the canyon.
Most of the equipment you'll need is still there,
  and as far as you've been able to discern there's no way to actually drive it here without going thousands of miles out of your way.
Perhaps you can rig a rope across the canyon and bring it across on a pulley,
  but you'd need to acquire those things first,
  and doing it purely by yourself would take a very long time.

Things come to a close, and Leon approaches you and the others.
He hands each of you a stack of plastic chips similar to  something, and you're able to get the gist of what he says to them.
Apparently, today is also payday.

----

The coins in your pouch are similar to the plastic badge you recieved earlier from the city gatehouse,
  but bear a very different &mdash; but still colorful &mdash; geometric design.

In addition to fourteen intact coins, there were also five wedges presumably cut from other coins,
  like old-fasioned pieces of eight.

These plastic coins are rather light in your large hands though,
  and you're not really sure of their value.
Presumably the larger ones are worth more, but how much more?

Probably first on your list is getting a larger apartment.
The tiny single room apartment you'd shared with Morgan and Jerry was better than sleeping in the rain,
  but you needed more space.
What could you even afford, though?

You'll also need space to set up your hydroponics to start growing Earth vegtables to supplement your diet,
  and the equipment needed to retrieve it from across the canyon,
  and probably a dozen other things.

Eventually, you turn to Morgan for help, and explain to her &mdash;
  you're pretty sure it's a 'her' &mdash; explain what you're considering, as best you can.

k: Need more space, this is too small for me.
m: I can take care of that, just let me do the haggling.
k: I also need to retrieve some of my stuff ...
when I landed here I landed on the other side of the canyon, and I had to leave a lot of my stuff on the other side.
k draws out a map.
k: I don't really know what the best way to get it all across is though,
I was thinking I could string a rope across and pull it across with a pulley, but I don't have any of that,
or even know where I'd get it
m: I come help you?
k: sure I could use all the help I can get. Where would I even get this stuff though? I don't even know how much that'll cost
j: I help too

kai, morgan, jerry; and also nydia, one of the othe two from the work crew

have better survey map of the canyon network
marked the position of the buggy and also best guess for the pod since they asked
go several miles upstream with the buggy to a point where the span is much shorter

how is stuff transported? pack animals? wagon? palanquin carried betwen two people?

practice how to do it, to make sure they knew what to do
launch rope across the gorge, tow a bigger cable plus another small cable across
both sides set up a-frame footer and dig a sand anchor
signal mirror flash to launching side indicating it's anchored, ready to tension the main cable
use small rope to pull payload attached to pulley across the canyon on the main cable

Similar principle to breeches buoy reenactments
